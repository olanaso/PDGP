# Scribe — Tome Batch Import Skill

Import a folder of ebooks into a running Tome instance.  Claude reads this
file and executes the workflow step-by-step.  The user never has to write
curl commands or parse JSON manually.

## Modes

- `/scribe <path>` — ingest a folder or set of files into Tome
- `/scribe update <query>` — refresh metadata on existing books by free-text query
- `/scribe audit [scope]` — scan for weak metadata and series title drift; offer bulk fixes
- `/scribe series <name>` — fill series-level metadata (status + arcs) from LLM knowledge

## Output discipline

Default mode is TERSE.  Never echo full metadata in the main flow.  Never
print per-file decision reasoning.  Print counts and ambiguous cases only.
Verbose output only when the user explicitly asks ("show details", "verbose",
"what did you pick for #3").  Judgment decisions are written to
`.scribe-state.json` in the target directory, not to chat.

Reason: output tokens cost ~5x input tokens.  A 200-book import should fit
in a screen.

---

## Profiles

A **profile** is a named connection to a Tome instance — its URL and API token.
All profiles live in `~/.config/tome/scribe.json` under the `profiles` key.

**Config shape:**
```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "dev":  {"url": "http://localhost:8080",    "token": "tome_..."},
    "prod": {"url": "https://tome.example.com", "token": "tome_..."}
  }
}
```

**How to add a profile:** say "add a profile", "add prod", or "register another instance".
Scribe will prompt for the name, URL, and token, validate connectivity, then merge
the new entry into `profiles` without touching existing ones.

**How to select a profile in a command:**
- Explicit: `"scribe on prod"`, `"use dev"`, `"/scribe --profile prod <path>"`,
  `"on prod, audit the manga library"` — Claude extracts the name and uses it.
- Implicit (single profile): if `profiles` has exactly one entry, use it silently.
- Unspecified (multiple profiles): Claude **always asks** — no default, no guessing.
  Example: `"Which instance? You have: dev, prod."` Wait for the answer before continuing.

**Config file location:** `~/.config/tome/scribe.json` (permissions: 600).

For full setup details and URL normalization rules, see Step 0 below.

---

## Step 0 — Config / first-run setup

Read `~/.config/tome/scribe.json`.

### 0a — Legacy migration (flat config)

If the file exists and has the old flat shape `{"url": "...", "token": "..."}` (no
`profiles` key), prompt the user once:

> "Found a single-profile config. What should I name it (e.g. 'dev', 'prod')?"

After they reply, rewrite the file as:
```json
{"profiles": {"<name>": {"url": "<existing url>", "token": "<existing token>"}}}
```
Preserve the existing `url` and `token` values exactly — do NOT re-validate or
re-prompt for them.  Then proceed normally with the named profile.

### 0b — Empty / missing file (first run)

If the file does not exist or is empty:

1. Tell the user: "Scribe needs a Tome instance name, URL, and an API token.
   Go to Tome → Settings → API Tokens, create one named e.g. `scribe-laptop`,
   and copy the token."
2. Ask in a single message: "Instance name (e.g. 'dev', 'prod')?" and
   "Tome URL (e.g. http://localhost:8080)?" and "API token?"
3. Once they reply, **normalize the URL before saving**:
   - Strip any path segments after the host:port — e.g.
     `http://localhost:8080/settings` → `http://localhost:8080`
   - If the port is `5173` (the Vite frontend dev server), swap it to `8080`
     (where Tome's API runs) and warn the user:
     "I'll use :8080 since that's where Tome's API runs."
   - Examples:
     - `http://localhost:5173/settings` → `http://localhost:8080`
     - `http://192.168.1.10:8080/books` → `http://192.168.1.10:8080`
     - `https://tome.example.com/settings` → `https://tome.example.com`
4. Validate connectivity **before writing the config**:

```bash
curl -sf -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "<NORMALIZED_URL>/api/health"
```

   - If the response is 200, write the file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/tome
cat > ~/.config/tome/scribe.json <<'EOF'
{"profiles": {"<NAME>": {"url": "<NORMALIZED_URL>", "token": "<TOKEN>"}}}
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.config/tome/scribe.json
```

   - If not 200, tell the user: "Could not reach Tome at <URL> — got HTTP
     <status>.  Please check the URL and token, then try again."  Do not save
     the config.  Ask the user to fix and retry.

### 0c — Adding a profile

If the user says "add a profile", "add prod", "register another instance", or similar:

1. Prompt: "Instance name?" and "Tome URL?" and "API token?"
2. Normalize the URL using the same rules as 0b.
3. Validate connectivity via `GET /api/health` as above.
4. On success, read the current `~/.config/tome/scribe.json`, merge the new profile
   into the `profiles` object, and write the file back.  Do not touch existing profiles.

### 0d — Profile selection

Before ANY action that hits Tome, resolve which profile to use:

- **Explicit in the command:** `"scribe on prod"`, `"use dev"`,
  `"/scribe --profile prod <path>"`, `"on prod, audit the manga library"` —
  extract the profile name and use it.  If that name does not exist in `profiles`,
  tell the user and list available names.
- **Single profile exists:** use it silently.  No prompt needed.
- **Multiple profiles, none specified:** **always ask. Never default. Never guess.**
  Prompt: `"Which instance? You have: dev, prod."` Wait for the user's reply
  before proceeding with any API call.

Once resolved, bind shell variables for the rest of the run:
```bash
PROFILE="<name>"
URL="<profiles[PROFILE].url>"
TOKEN="<profiles[PROFILE].token>"
```

All subsequent steps use `$URL` and `$TOKEN` sourced from the selected profile.

---

## Step 1 — Discover

Run the extract script against the target path.  The script is at
`skills/scribe/scripts/extract.py` relative to the Tome repo root.  Resolve
the repo root as the directory containing this SKILL.md's parent `skills/`
folder.

### Calling extract.py — argument rules

**Never call extract.py with a single file path when the user intended a
batch.**  The script recurses directories; calling it on a single file gives
"Found 1 files" and loses the rest of the batch.

- **User passes a directory** → call `extract.py <dir>` — it recurses.
- **User passes individual files or multiple files from the same parent** →
  call `extract.py <common_parent_dir>` once, then filter the resulting JSON
  array to only the entries whose `path` appears in the user's list.
- **Mixed paths from different parents** → find the deepest common ancestor
  directory, call `extract.py <common_ancestor>`, then filter to the user's
  list.

```bash
EXTRACT="<abs-path-to-repo>/skills/scribe/scripts/extract.py"
python3 "$EXTRACT" "<target_path>" > /tmp/scribe_files.json
```

Parse the JSON array.  Each item has: `path`, `format`, `size_bytes`,
`content_hash`, `embedded` (dict of title/author/series/series_index/year/
isbn/language), `filename_hints` (same fields parsed from filename).

After filtering to the user's intended files (if applicable), write the
filtered list back to `/tmp/scribe_files.json`.

Print: `"Found N files."` — nothing more.

---

## Step 2 — Resume check

If `<target_path>/.scribe-state.json` exists, read it.

Check that the `profile` field inside the state JSON matches the currently
active `$PROFILE`.  If it does not match, warn:

> "This state file was created against profile '<old_profile>', but you are
> currently using '<current_profile>'.  Resuming may apply changes to the
> wrong Tome instance.  Continue anyway? (yes / start fresh)"

If the profile matches (or the user confirms), ask:
`"Found a previous run with X files processed. Resume? (yes / start fresh)"`

If resuming: load state and skip to Step 5 (upload), processing only entries
whose `status` is not `"uploaded"`.

If starting fresh or no state file: proceed.

---

## Step 3 — Deduplicate

Extract all `content_hash` values from the discovered files and POST to
check-hashes:

```bash
HASHES=$(python3 -c "
import json, sys
files = json.load(open('/tmp/scribe_files.json'))
print(json.dumps({'hashes': [f['content_hash'] for f in files]}))
")
curl -sf -X POST "$URL/api/books/check-hashes" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$HASHES" > /tmp/scribe_existing.json
```

Remove files whose `content_hash` appears in `existing`.  Print:
`"Skipped N duplicates."` (or omit the line if 0).

---

## Step 4 — Fetch libraries and book types

```bash
curl -sf -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "$URL/api/libraries" \
  > /tmp/scribe_libraries.json
curl -sf -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "$URL/api/book-types" \
  > /tmp/scribe_book_types.json
```

Parse both.  You will use them for library assignment in Step 4c.

---

## Step 4a — Ingest with embedded metadata (batch)

For each non-duplicate file, upload it immediately using the `embedded`
metadata from the extract step.  Do NOT wait for metadata fetching first —
ingest creates the book record so we can call `fetch-metadata` against its id.

Build the metadata JSON from `embedded` fields.  Apply filename_hints as
fallback for missing fields.  Always include `title` (required).

```bash
# For each file:
METADATA=$(python3 -c "
import json
embedded = <embedded dict>
hints = <filename_hints dict>
# Merge: embedded wins over hints
merged = {**hints, **{k: v for k, v in embedded.items() if v is not None}}
# Keep only ingest-schema fields
fields = ['title','subtitle','author','series','series_index','isbn',
          'publisher','description','language','year','tags',
          'library_ids','book_type_id']
out = {k: merged[k] for k in fields if k in merged}
print(json.dumps(out))
")
curl -sf -X POST "$URL/api/books/ingest" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@<abs_path>" \
  -F "metadata=$METADATA" \
  -w "\n%{http_code}" \
  > /tmp/scribe_upload_<i>.json
```

On HTTP 201: record `book_id` from response.
On HTTP 409: the file is a duplicate (race condition with Step 3). Note as
  skipped.
On other errors: log the error, mark file as failed, continue.

Save all results to `.scribe-state.json` in the target dir after each file
(so a crash is resumable).

State file schema:
```json
{
  "profile": "<active profile name>",
  "target_path": "/abs/path",
  "run_at": "ISO timestamp",
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "/abs/path/to/file.epub",
      "content_hash": "abc...",
      "status": "pending|uploaded|skipped|error",
      "book_id": 42,
      "error": null,
      "confidence": "auto|ambiguous|no_match|null",
      "chosen_candidate_index": null,
      "metadata_applied": false,
      "pinned_fields": null
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: the `profile` field at the top level is used by Step 2's resume check
to detect cross-profile resume attempts.

After the full batch, print one terse line:
`"Uploaded N. Skipped K (duplicates/errors). Errors: [list if any]"`

---

## Step 4b — Context enrichment — check Tome for siblings

**Run this before the pre-classification.**  For each uploaded file in the
batch, look up existing books in Tome that share the same series or author.
Record any matches as `pinned_fields` in the state file.

Sibling-lookup is context enrichment only.  Finding siblings does NOT skip
fetch-metadata.  It only pins canonical fields (author, series spelling,
book_type, library assignment, title_template) so the candidate scoring and
apply step can use them to improve accuracy and prevent series drift.

No chat output unless the user asks.

For each file:

1. Derive a `series` guess from `embedded.series` or `filename_hints.series`.
2. If `series` is non-empty, query Tome:

```bash
curl -sf -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "$URL/api/books?series=<url-encoded-series-name>" \
  > /tmp/scribe_siblings_<i>.json
```

   The `series` query param is an exact-match filter (confirmed against
   `backend/api/books.py`).  URL-encode the series name.

3. If results exist (at least one book), extract `pinned_fields` from the
   first (lowest `series_index`) sibling:
   - `author` — exact string from the sibling book
   - `series` — exact canonical spelling/casing
   - `book_type_id` — from the sibling book
   - `library_ids` — from the sibling book
   - `title_template` — inspect the sibling titles and detect the pattern:
     - If siblings are titled "Sherlock Holmes, Vol. 1", "Sherlock Holmes, Vol. 2" →
       template is `"Sherlock Holmes, Vol. <index>"`
     - If siblings use inconsistent formats (i.e. would be Case B under the
       drift detection rule in Step A2), omit `title_template` — do not guess
       a canonical form here.  The audit mode's drift detection step will surface
       the inconsistency properly.
     - Only set `title_template` if at least 2 siblings exist and they agree

4. If no series, fall back to `author` lookup:

```bash
curl -sf -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "$URL/api/books?author=<url-encoded-author>" \
  > /tmp/scribe_siblings_<i>.json
```

   Extract `author`, `book_type_id`, `library_ids` from the first result.
   Do **not** set `title_template` for author-only lookups.

5. If no siblings at all, `pinned_fields` is `null` — normal flow continues.

Write `pinned_fields` into each file's state entry.  Do not print anything.

---

## Step 4c — Pre-classify metadata quality (silent)

Before calling any external API, inspect each ingested book's metadata
(already captured from the extract step) and classify it silently as
`confidence: "auto"` or `confidence: "ambiguous"`.  Persist the classification
to `.scribe-state.json`.  Print nothing.

This classification only decides **how candidates are presented to the user
after fetch**.  It does NOT skip fetching.

**Auto — top candidate is applied silently after fetch:**
- Title is present, non-empty, and does not look like a filename artifact
  (e.g. "chapter-03", "vol_12", a bare number, "Book", "Untitled").
- Author is present and non-empty.
- At least one of `{year, isbn, publisher}` is present.
- Filename hints do not contradict embedded metadata egregiously (e.g.
  filename says "Sherlock Holmes vol 3" but embedded title is "Around the World in Eighty Days" →
  not auto).

**Ambiguous — surface candidates to the user after fetch:**
- Title or author missing, empty, or obviously garbage.
- All publication fields (`year`, `isbn`, `publisher`) are absent.
- Embedded metadata vs. filename hints disagree on title or series.
- Title looks auto-generated ("Book", "Untitled", a bare number, or a
  slug-style string like "chapter-03").

Add `confidence` and `metadata_applied` fields to each file's state entry.
Do NOT print per-file decisions.

---

## Step 4d — Fetch metadata candidates (ALL books)

**Fetch-metadata runs for every ingested book without exception.**  Even if
sibling-lookup found matches, or the pre-classification is `auto`, every book
still needs a candidate fetch — because description, cover, year, publisher,
tags, and ISBN are per-book fields that siblings cannot supply.

For each uploaded book, call:

```bash
curl -sf -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "$URL/api/books/<book_id>/fetch-metadata" \
  > /tmp/scribe_candidates_<book_id>.json
```

**Important:** `GET /api/books/{book_id}/fetch-metadata` requires an existing
book_id. This is why ingest comes before metadata fetch — the book must exist
first.  You can optionally pass `?q=<title+author>` to override the search
query if embedded metadata is weak.

Run all curl calls concurrently (via `&` + `wait` in bash, or sequentially if
count <= 10 to avoid hammering external APIs).

Do NOT print anything per-book.

After receiving candidates, score and classify each result using the
**candidate scoring heuristic** below.  Pick the highest-scoring candidate as
the top-ranked choice; if multiple candidates tie or none pass the threshold,
keep the `ambiguous` classification from Step 4c.

Classification rules (applied after scoring, may override Step 4c):
- `auto`: top candidate scores >= 5 AND no other candidate is within 2 points
  of it — apply silently without user interaction.
- `ambiguous`: candidates exist but none pass the `auto` threshold, OR multiple
  pass with very similar scores — surface to user for manual resolution.
- `no_match`: zero candidates returned — keep embedded/pinned fields as-is.

Write classification + chosen candidate index (best score for `auto`;
`null` for `ambiguous` and `no_match`) to the state file.

Do NOT print per-file decisions.

---

## Candidate scoring heuristic

Apply this to every candidate for a given book.  Sum the points; higher is
better.  Use this consistently — do not invent a different scorer at runtime.

| Condition | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| `candidate.title` matches `pinned_fields.title_template` exactly (case-insensitive, index substituted) | +8 |
| `candidate.author` matches `pinned_fields.author` (case-insensitive) | +5 |
| `candidate.author` matches filename-hint author (case-insensitive) | +5 |
| `candidate.series_index` equals parsed filename/embedded volume number | +4 |
| `candidate.title` contains the series name (case-insensitive) | +3 |
| `candidate.year` is within ±1 of embedded/filename year | +2 |
| `candidate.author` disagrees with any pinned field | -3 |
| `candidate.series` disagrees with `pinned_fields.series` (both present, clearly different) | -3 |
| `candidate.title` contains a foreign-edition keyword (regex `\b(max\|deluxe\|gigante\|band\|maximum\|edizione\|integrale\|kanzenban)\b`, case-insensitive) and the pinned language is English | -8 |

**Why the foreign-edition penalty:** without it, candidates like "Berserk Max
Band 12" tie with "Berserk, Vol. 12" on series-index + author, and source
tie-break picks the wrong one.  The penalty breaks the tie decisively.

**Tie-break:** prefer source order **Hardcover > Google Books > Open Library**.
This matches the backend's actual fetch order in `backend/services/metadata_fetch.py`
(Hardcover results are prepended first, then Google Books, then Open Library).

---

## Web fallback for missing descriptions

This subsection applies whenever a book's best metadata candidate has an
empty, null, or short description.  It is used in ingest (after Step 4d),
update (after Step U4), and audit (after Step A4) — wherever descriptions are
being enriched.

**Trigger conditions (check both):**

1. The top-ranked candidate's `description` field is null, empty string, or
   shorter than 200 characters.
2. The field being filled is `description` only.  Do NOT use web search to
   override author, series, year, cover, or other fields — those come from
   fetch-metadata candidates, sibling pinning, or user input.

**Procedure:**

1. Build a search query: `"<title>" <author> book plot summary`
   - Quote the title (wrap in `"`) if it has more than two words.
   - Include the author if known.
   - Examples:
     - `"Barsoom" Edgar Rice Burroughs book plot summary`
     - `"Around the World in Eighty Days" Jules Verne book plot summary`

2. Run `WebSearch` with that query.

3. Pick the **top trustworthy result** in priority order:
   - Goodreads
   - Wikipedia
   - Official publisher page (VIZ, Dark Horse, Yen Press, Tor, Del Rey, etc.)
   - Author's official site
   - Skip: blogs, fan wikis, obvious SEO spam, "top 10 books" listicles,
     retailer product pages (Amazon, Barnes & Noble) — these often have
     truncated or marketing-copy descriptions.

4. Run `WebFetch` on the chosen URL.  Extract only the synopsis /
   description / plot-summary section.  Apply these constraints:
   - Minimum useful length: 100 characters (below this, discard and fall back).
   - Maximum to apply: 2000 characters.  Trim at the nearest sentence boundary.
   - Strip: star ratings, review quotes, "also by the author" sections,
     metadata sidebars, "buy now" CTAs, chapter lists, spoiler sections.

5. Verify the fetched text is for the **correct book** — check that title and
   author are mentioned or clearly implied.  If the page is for a different
   edition, different volume, or a different book entirely, discard it.

6. If the web result is still empty, too short, or clearly wrong after steps
   3-5, fall back to the original candidate's description even if it is short,
   or leave the field empty.  Log a note in the state file (`"web_fallback":
   "failed — no good result"`).  Do not keep retrying with more URLs.

**Source attribution in reports:**

When a description is sourced from a web fallback, note the source in the
user-facing diff / apply report.  Examples:

```
#1 A Princess of Mars  [id=10]
  description:  (empty) → 489c  [from Wikipedia]
```

Do **not** embed attribution text inside the description field itself — keep
the stored description clean.

**State file field:**

Add `"web_fallback_source": "<url or null>"` to the per-book state entry when
a web fallback is used.  This allows the run to be audited later.

---

## Cover placeholder detection and fallback

This subsection applies whenever a cover is being applied from a
fetch-metadata candidate or a `cover-candidates` result — during ingest
(Step 4d/4f), update mode, or audit mode.

**Why it exists:** Hardcover and Google Books occasionally return generic
placeholder images instead of real covers — a blank grey/blue JPEG, a
series-logo stock card, or the publisher's default-cover art.  Applied blindly,
these replace decent embedded covers with worse ones.

**Placeholder signals (check the fetched image, not the URL):**

1. File size is suspiciously small or suspiciously uniform across volumes:
   - Under ~20 KB is almost always a placeholder.
   - Identical byte size across multiple volumes of the same series is a
     strong signal the source is returning the same stock image.
2. Image dimensions are tiny (< 200px on the shorter edge) or exactly square
   for a format that is normally portrait (manga/comics are ~2:3).
3. The image is visually a solid color — low variance across pixels.  A
   quick heuristic: if the first-byte histogram of a JPEG is dominated by a
   single byte run, it is probably solid-fill.
4. The same cover URL / same content-hash appears for multiple adjacent
   volumes in the same series (the source is repeating stock art).

**Fallback order when a placeholder is detected:**

1. Try the next candidate in source-rank order: **Hardcover → Google Books
   → Open Library**.  Skip any candidate that matches the placeholder signals
   above.
2. If all `fetch-metadata` candidates fail, call
   `GET /api/books/{id}/cover-candidates` — this is a separate endpoint that
   aggregates cover art specifically, and sometimes returns options that the
   metadata fetcher omitted.
3. If that also fails, do a `WebSearch` for the publisher's official product
   page: `"<series>" vol <N> <publisher> cover`.  Prefer Dark Horse, VIZ, Yen
   Press, Seven Seas, Kodansha, Tor, Del Rey over retailer pages.  `WebFetch`
   the page and extract the canonical cover asset URL.
4. Apply via `POST /api/books/{id}/cover` with form field `url=<image_url>`.
   The backend downloads and caches the image under `data/covers/`.
5. If no good cover is findable after steps 1-3, leave the existing cover
   (or keep the field empty) and note `"cover_fallback": "failed"` in the
   state file.  Do not keep trying.

**Source attribution in reports:**

```
#12 Berserk, Vol. 19  [id=506]
  cover:  (placeholder, 8.2 KB) → 412 KB  [from Dark Horse]
```

**State file field:**

Add `"cover_fallback_source": "<url or null>"` to the per-book state entry
when a cover fallback is used.

---

## Step 4e — Library assignment

Default rule: assign each book to the library associated with its book_type
(the `library_id` field on the BookType).  If book_type_id was not set (no
embedded metadata for it), assign to no library for now.

If `pinned_fields.library_ids` exists for a book, use those library IDs
instead of the default rule.

If 5 or more books share the same series or author and have no book_type_id,
ask once: `"N books look like <series/author> — which book type? (options:
<list slugs from /api/book-types>)"`.  Apply that type to all of them via
`PUT /api/books/<id>` with `{"book_type_id": <id>}`.

Never ask per-book questions about library assignment.

---

## Step 5 — Report ambiguous cases

After fetch and scoring, print a terse summary:

```
Uploaded 42  |  auto-applied 38  |  needs review 3  |  no candidates 1  |  skipped 2 dups
```

Then render a compact table of ambiguous books only:

```
#  Title (embedded)            Candidates
1  Some Book Name              [A] "Some Book" 2019 Penguin  [B] "Some Book Name" 2021 Tor  [C] "Some Book" 2018 (no publisher)
2  Another Title               [A] "Another Title" by J. Smith 2020  [B] "Another" by J. Smith 2019
3  Unknown Title               (no candidates)
```

Then prompt: `"How should I handle these? Options: 'accept all A', '#2 use B',
'#3 skip metadata', 'skip all', or 'show me #1's full candidates'."`

---

## Step 6 — User resolves ambiguous

Parse the user's reply.  Examples:

- `"accept all A"` → use candidate index 0 for all ambiguous books
- `"accept all"` → use best-scored candidate for each
- `"#2 is B"` → use candidate index 1 for book #2
- `"#3 skip"` or `"skip #3"` → leave book #3 with embedded metadata only
- `"show #1"` → print all candidate fields for book #1 (verbose drill-down)
- `"skip all"` → leave all ambiguous with embedded metadata

After resolution, apply chosen candidates via:

```bash
curl -sf -X POST "$URL/api/books/<book_id>/apply-metadata" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '<ApplyMetadataRequest JSON>'
```

### Respecting pinned fields at apply time

`POST /api/books/{id}/apply-metadata` supports partial payloads — only
provided fields are updated.  Use this to protect pinned values:

1. Start from the chosen candidate's fields.
2. **Overwrite** any key that exists in `pinned_fields` back to the pinned
   value — never let a candidate's value replace a pinned field.
3. If `pinned_fields.title_template` is set, regenerate the title:
   - Find the volume/series_index for this book (from candidate, embedded, or
     filename hint — in that priority order).
   - Substitute into the template, e.g. template `"Sherlock Holmes, Vol. <index>"` +
     index `3` → title `"Sherlock Holmes, Vol. 3"`.
4. Build the final payload from the modified fields and POST it.

Rationale: this prevents series drift.  If `fetch-metadata` returns
`"Doyle Arthur Conan"` but all existing siblings use `"Arthur Conan Doyle"`, we keep
the consistent spelling.

For `auto` books, apply the chosen candidate automatically (no user
interaction), respecting pinned fields as above.

For `no_match`, apply nothing (embedded stays).

---

## Step 7 — Final summary

Print one terse line:

```
Done. Uploaded 42 books, applied metadata on 38, skipped 3 (1 duplicate, 2 errors).
See $URL/books for review.
```

Offer: `"Type 'list errors' for details or 'show skipped' to see what was
left out."`

Clean up `/tmp/scribe_*.json` temp files.

---

## Notes on API shape (verified against Tome source)

- `POST /api/books/check-hashes` — body `{"hashes": [...]}`, response
  `{"existing": {"<hash>": <book_id>}}`.  Auth: Bearer token.

- `POST /api/books/ingest` — multipart form: `file` (binary) + `metadata`
  (JSON string).  Returns 201 + BookDetailOut on success, 409 +
  `{"detail": {"detail": "duplicate", "existing_id": N}}` on dup.
  Sets `is_reviewed=true` automatically.

- `GET /api/books?series=<exact-name>` — exact-match series filter.  Returns
  paginated book list.  Also supports `?author=<name>` for author filtering.
  Both are simple string equality checks in the backend (not substring/fuzzy).

- `GET /api/books/{book_id}/fetch-metadata?q=<optional override>` — returns
  `list[MetadataCandidateOut]`.  Each candidate: `source`, `source_id`,
  `title`, `author`, `description`, `cover_url`, `publisher`, `year`,
  `page_count`, `isbn`, `language`, `tags`, `series`, `series_index`.

- `POST /api/books/{book_id}/apply-metadata` — body: any subset of
  `title`, `author`, `description`, `publisher`, `year`, `language`, `isbn`,
  `tags`, `series`, `series_index`, `cover_url`.  Only provided fields are
  updated (partial payload supported).

- `GET /api/libraries` — returns list of `{id, name, icon, is_public, ...}`.

- `GET /api/book-types` — returns list of `{id, slug, label, library_id, ...}`.

- `PUT /api/books/{book_id}` — body: any BookUpdate fields.  Use for
  post-upload corrections.

- Auth header for all requests: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` where token
  was created in Tome → Settings → API Tokens.

- `GET /api/series/{name}/meta` — returns `{series_name, status}`.  Never
  404s; returns `status: "unknown"` if no row exists yet.

- `PUT /api/series/{name}/meta` — admin only.  Body `{"status": "ongoing"|"finished"|"hiatus"|"unknown"}`.
  Returns the updated meta object.

- `GET /api/series/{name}/arcs` — returns list of arcs sorted by `start_index`.
  Each arc: `{id, series_name, name, start_index, end_index, description, created_at, updated_at}`.

- `POST /api/series/{name}/arcs/bulk` — admin only.  Body is an array of arc
  objects.  Diffs against existing by `name` field: same name = update, name
  absent from payload = delete, new names = create.  Returns the new canonical
  arc list.

**Mismatch with original spec:** The spec described `POST /api/books/fetch-metadata`
(standalone, no book_id).  That endpoint does not exist.  The actual endpoint
is `GET /api/books/{book_id}/fetch-metadata`, so books must be ingested before
metadata can be fetched.  Scribe's workflow reflects this: ingest first, then
fetch metadata against the created book_id.

---

## Update mode — `/scribe update <query>`

Refresh metadata on books that already exist in Tome.  Works on any subset of
the library: a single book, a whole series, all books of a given type, etc.

### Trigger forms

- "check metadata for tarzan"
- "check metadata for all burroughs books"
- "can you quickly check all novel volumes"
- "update descriptions for books in my Classics library"
- "refresh metadata for book 271"

The free-text query is natural language.  Parse the intent, do not require the
user to know API param names.

Profile selection (Step 0d) applies before any API call is made.

---

### Step U1 — Interpret the query

Map natural language to `GET /api/books` filter params.  Verified param names
(from `backend/api/books.py`):

| Phrase | Param used |
|--------|-----------|
| "X series" / "all X books" | `series=X` (exact match) |
| "books by X" / "X books" (no series context) | `author=X` |
| "book 271" / "book id 271" | skip GET — fetch `GET /api/books/271` directly |
| free text (title keyword) | `q=<text>` |
| "books in library Y" | resolve `library_id` via `GET /api/libraries`, then `library_id=<id>` |
| "manga" / "comics" / "novels" | **no `book_type_id` filter exists on `GET /api/books`** — instead use `q=<type label>` or look up the book type's associated `library_id` via `GET /api/book-types` and filter by that |
| "added by X" | `added_by=<user_id>` (admin only) |

All `GET /api/books` calls use `$URL` and `$TOKEN` from the selected profile.

**Fallback chain for ambiguous series/author queries:**

1. Try `series=<query>` — if results come back, use them.
2. If no results, try `author=<query>`.
3. If still nothing, try `q=<query>` (full-text).
4. If still nothing, ask the user once for clarification.

**Type-label resolution:** `GET /api/book-types` returns `{id, slug, label, library_id}`.
If the user says "manga volumes" or "light novels", find the matching book type
by `slug` or `label`, then use its `library_id` as the `library_id` filter param.
This is the correct workaround since `book_type_id` is not a filter param on
`GET /api/books`.

If the query is genuinely ambiguous after exhausting the above (e.g. "burroughs"
could be a series name or an author name), ask once before querying.

---

### Step U2 — Confirm scope

After the GET, print a terse summary and wait for confirmation if more than
3 books matched:

```
Found 24 books in series 'Tarzan' by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Fetch candidates and review updates?
```

If 1-3 books matched, skip the confirmation and proceed directly.

---

### Step U3 — Sibling context (series queries only)

If the query targeted a specific series (i.e. `series=<name>` was used), apply
the same sibling-pinning logic as Step 4b of the ingest workflow:

- Extract `author`, `series`, `book_type_id`, `library_ids`, and
  `title_template` from the existing books in the result set (lowest
  `series_index` first).
- Use these as `pinned_fields` when scoring and applying candidates.

For heterogeneous queries (full-text, author-only, library-wide), skip sibling
pinning — books are processed individually without cross-book constraints.

---

### Step U4 — Per-book fetch and score

After fetching candidates, apply the **web fallback for missing descriptions**
(defined above in the ingest section) for any book whose top candidate has a
null, empty, or sub-200-character description.

For each matched book, call:

```bash
curl -sf -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "$URL/api/books/<book_id>/fetch-metadata" \
  > /tmp/scribe_update_<book_id>.json
```

Score candidates using the **candidate scoring heuristic** (defined above in
the ingest workflow — do not redefine it here, use exactly the same table).
Apply pinned fields from Step U3 where available.

Write a state file at `~/.cache/tome-scribe/.scribe-update-<profile>-<timestamp>.json`
(create `~/.cache/tome-scribe/` if missing) after each book fetch so the run
is resumable on Ctrl-C.  Including `<profile>` in the filename ensures that a
resume attempt only picks up state files for the currently-active profile —
files for other profiles are ignored.

State file schema (update variant):

```json
{
  "mode": "update",
  "profile": "<active profile name>",
  "query": "<original user query>",
  "run_at": "ISO timestamp",
  "books": [
    {
      "book_id": 42,
      "title": "Tarzan, Vol. 1",
      "status": "pending|fetched|applied|skipped|error",
      "chosen_candidate_index": null,
      "pinned_fields": null,
      "diff": null,
      "error": null
    }
  ]
}
```

**Resume:** on start, check `~/.cache/tome-scribe/` for any
`.scribe-update-<profile>-*.json` file (matching the current active profile)
whose `status` contains at least one `"pending"` or `"fetched"` entry.
If found, ask:
`"Found an in-progress update run from <timestamp>. Resume? (yes / start fresh)"`
Ignore state files belonging to other profiles.

---

### Step U5 — Diff preview

For each book, compute a field-level diff between the **current book state**
and the top-ranked candidate (with pinned overrides applied).  Omit fields
that are unchanged.

Present diffs in a compact block — all books together, one entry per book:

```
#1 Tarzan, Vol. 3  [id=42]
  description:  (empty) → 512c
  year:         null → 1914
  cover:        none → openlibrary.org

#2 Tarzan, Vol. 7  [id=55]
  title:        "Tarzan v7" → "Tarzan, Vol. 7"   [pinned template]
  description:  (empty) → 488c
  tags:          [] → ["adventure", "classic"]
```

Rules for compact display:
- `description`: show char count of new value (e.g. `488c`), not the full text.
- `cover`: show only the domain of the URL (e.g. `openlibrary.org`, `books.google.com`), not the full URL.
- `title`: if the change is driven by a pinned template, append `[pinned template]`.
- If a book has no changes (candidate matches current state), show
  `#N <Title>  [id=X]  — no changes` and exclude it from the apply step.

Then prompt:

```
42 books — 38 with changes, 4 unchanged. Apply? Options:
  "accept all" — apply every diff
  "skip #3" — exclude that book, apply the rest
  "show #5" — verbose drill-down on book #5's full candidate list
  "cancel" — discard all without applying
```

---

### Step U6 — Apply

Parse the user's response:

- `"accept all"` → apply every diff that has changes
- `"skip #N"` → exclude book N, apply the rest
- `"show #N"` → print all candidate fields for book N (title, author, year,
  publisher, description snippet, source, cover URL); do not apply yet; re-prompt
- `"cancel"` → discard without applying; delete the state file

For each book to apply, use `POST /api/books/{id}/apply-metadata` (with
`$URL` and `$TOKEN` from the selected profile) with the merged payload
(candidate fields overwritten by pinned fields, same logic as Step 6 /
"Respecting pinned fields at apply time" in the ingest workflow).

Print terse progress while applying: `"Applied 1/38... 2/38..."`.

Final report: `"Updated 38. Skipped 4. Errors 0."`

Delete the state file on clean completion.

---

## Audit mode — `/scribe audit [scope]`

Scan the library for books with weak metadata, fetch candidates for the weak
ones, and apply fixes with user approval.

### Trigger forms

- `/scribe audit` — all books (null/missing fields + series drift)
- `/scribe audit years [scope]` — publication-year drift check (see "Year-drift audit" subsection below)
- `/scribe audit editions [scope]` — wrong-edition ISBN check for manga/light-novel libraries (see "Edition audit" subsection below)
- "audit metadata" / "find books with missing metadata"
- "audit the manga library" / "audit books in Light Novels"
- "audit books by X"
- "audit years", "check publication years", "verify years for tarzan"
- "audit editions", "check for wrong-edition ISBNs", "is any light novel carrying a manga ISBN"

Narrow scope is parsed with the same natural-language interpretation as
Update mode Step U1.

Profile selection (Step 0d) applies before any API call is made.

---

### Weak-metadata criteria

A book is **weak** if any of the following are true:

| Field | Weak condition |
|-------|----------------|
| `description` | null or empty string |
| `year` | null |
| `cover_path` | null or empty string |
| Series title drift | within a series, titles are inconsistent across books (see drift detection rule below) |
| Year drift | stored `year` differs from Open Library's `first_publish_year` by more than 3 years (requires fetch — see Year-drift audit below) |

Do **not** flag missing `isbn`, `publisher`, or `subtitle` — these are
legitimately absent on many books.

---

### Year-drift audit (trigger: `/scribe audit years [scope]`)

**Motivation:** embedded/ingested metadata often has the *edition* or *reprint*
year, not the *first publication* year.  For a classic like Tarzan, stored
year might be `2008` (Penguin reprint) when the book was actually first
published in `1914`.  This matters if we later embed Tome metadata into the
files on disk — we want the real year baked in.

**Trigger forms:**
- `/scribe audit years` — check every book
- `/scribe audit years <scope>` — narrow scope, same natural-language parsing
  as Update mode Step U1 (series, author, library, free-text)
- "audit years", "check years for tarzan", "verify publication years in
  Classics library"

**How year trust works per source:**

| Source | Year field meaning | Trust for first-pub? |
|--------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Open Library | `first_publish_year` (already parsed as `year` in the candidate dataclass) | **Authoritative** — use for drift detection |
| Hardcover | `release_year` (edition, not first-pub) | Not reliable — ignore for drift |
| Google Books | edition year parsed from `publishedDate` | Not reliable — ignore for drift |

**Detection is fetch-based, not scan-based.**  Unlike null/missing fields,
year drift cannot be detected from the DB alone — it requires comparing
stored values against external sources.  So year-drift audit always runs
`fetch-metadata` on every book in scope, regardless of whether other weak
criteria apply.

**Procedure:**

1. Resolve scope via the same natural-language parsing as Update mode Step U1.
   Confirm with the user before fetching if scope has more than ~20 books
   (time estimate: `ceil(count / 10)` minutes).

2. For each book in scope, call `GET /api/books/<book_id>/fetch-metadata`
   concurrently (batches of 10).

3. For each response, find the **first Open Library candidate** in the list
   (identified by `source == "open_library"`).  If no OL candidate exists,
   mark the book `no_ol_candidate` and move on — do not use Hardcover or
   Google year for drift.

4. Compare `stored_year` against `ol_candidate.year`:
   - Both present and `abs(stored - ol) > 3` → **drift**
   - Stored missing and OL present → **missing year** (normal weak case, not
     drift — handled by the regular audit flow)
   - OL missing → `no_signal`, skip

5. Write a state file at `~/.cache/tome-scribe/.scribe-audit-years-<profile>-<timestamp>.json`
   (same directory convention as other audit/update state files).  Persist
   after each fetch so the run is resumable.  Schema:

```json
{
  "mode": "audit-years",
  "profile": "<active profile name>",
  "scope": "<description>",
  "run_at": "ISO timestamp",
  "books": [
    {
      "book_id": 42,
      "title": "Tarzan, Vol. 1",
      "stored_year": 2008,
      "ol_year": 1912,
      "delta": 96,
      "status": "pending|drift|match|no_ol_candidate|no_signal|applied|skipped"
    }
  ]
}
```

6. Present drift cases in a compact block, grouped by magnitude:

```
34 books scanned · 8 drift · 22 match · 3 no OL candidate · 1 no signal

Year drift (OL first_publish_year vs. stored):
  #id=42  "Tarzan, Vol. 1"       2008 → 1912   (Δ 96y)
  #id=55  "A Princess of Mars"   2011 → 1912   (Δ 99y)
  #id=71  "The Gods of Mars"     2010 → 1913   (Δ 97y)
  #id=88  "Sherlock Holmes v3"   1995 → 1892   (Δ 103y)
  ...

Apply? Options:
  "accept all"       — update all drift cases
  "skip #N"          — exclude a specific book
  "show #N"          — verbose: print all OL candidate fields
  "threshold 10"     — re-filter to only drift > 10 years (drop noise)
  "cancel"           — discard without applying
```

7. On `accept all` or selective apply, use `POST /api/books/{id}/apply-metadata`
   with `{"year": <ol_year>}` only — **never** pull other fields from the OL
   candidate here.  This step corrects year only; other fields stay as-is.

8. Final summary:
   ```
   Year audit complete. 34 scanned · 8 drift · 7 corrected · 1 skipped · 0 errors
   ```
   Delete the state file on clean completion.

**Edge case — ranges and approximate dates:** OL occasionally returns wide
ranges or centuries for old works (e.g. `first_publish_year: 1605` for a
modern edition of Don Quixote).  Trust OL in these cases — ancient/classic
first-pub years are usually correct in OL even if pre-modern.

**Never** auto-apply year corrections without surfacing them.  Even perfect
confidence requires explicit user approval — same rule as series title
drift.

---

### Edition audit (trigger: `/scribe audit editions [scope]`)

**Motivation:** older Tome versions auto-applied the top metadata candidate
blindly, which could write the WRONG edition's identity onto a book — the
manga adaptation's ISBN (and sometimes publisher/description) on a light
novel, or vice versa.  A wrong stored ISBN then *monopolises* every later
fetch (ISBN queries dominate retrieval), so the damage self-perpetuates
until the ISBN itself is corrected.  This check found and fixed 5 such books
on a real 560-book library (4 Slime LNs + 1 Black Summoner LN carrying manga
ISBNs).

**Scope:** books that have an ISBN **and** a book type classifying as
sequential-art (manga/comics/webtoon-like slugs) or light-novel/prose.
Resolve `book_type_id → slug` via `GET /api/book-types`.  Books without an
ISBN or with untyped/other types are skipped.

**Detection is fetch-based** (like year drift): for each book in scope call
`GET /api/books/<id>/fetch-metadata` in batches of 4 (external sources are
rate-limited; if the response carries `sources` with `"hardcover":
"rate_limited"`, pause 60 s and retry that book — do not classify a
rate-limited response).  Handle both response shapes: newer servers return
`{"candidates": [...], "sources": {...}}`, older ones a bare list.

Classify by finding the candidate whose `isbn` equals the stored ISBN:

| Observation | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Stored-ISBN candidate title contains `(Manga)` but the book type is light-novel/prose | **wrong_edition** |
| Stored-ISBN candidate title contains `(Light Novel)` but the book type is sequential-art | **wrong_edition** |
| Stored-ISBN candidate matches the book's edition class | match |
| No candidate carries the stored ISBN | no_signal |
| Stored-ISBN candidate has no edition label in its title | unlabelled (fine — most single-edition series are unlabelled) |

**Correction:** the same fetch response usually already contains the right
edition (newer servers bias retrieval toward the book's edition when the
stored ISBN looks suspect).  Pick the top candidate that (a) does NOT
violate the edition class and (b) matches the volume (`series_index`
equal).  Propose a patch of `isbn` (always) plus `publisher`, `year` and
`description` from that candidate — the old auto-apply usually poisoned
those too.  Do NOT touch title, series or cover (covers were typically
corrected by hand long ago; check before clobbering).

State file: `~/.cache/tome-scribe/.scribe-audit-editions-<profile>-<timestamp>.json`,
same conventions as the year audit (persist per fetch, resumable, delete on
clean completion).

Present findings compactly and require explicit approval, same options as
the year audit (`accept all` / `skip #N` / `show #N` / `cancel`):

```
333 books scanned · 5 wrong edition · 60 match · 251 unlabelled · 17 no signal

Wrong-edition ISBNs:
  #id=54  "That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime" (light_novel, vol 13)
          stored 9781646510078 → "…(Manga), Vol. 13" [Kodansha Comics]
          fix    9781975314460 → "…(Light Novel), Vol. 13" [Yen On]
  ...
```

On apply, `POST /api/books/{id}/apply-metadata` with only the proposed
fields.  Re-verify by re-fetching once and confirming the stored-ISBN
candidate now matches the edition class.

---

### Step A1 — Scope

Default: all books via paginated `GET /api/books`.  Narrow scope using the
same filter-param mapping as Update mode Step U1.

Before proceeding, confirm scope with the user:

```
Auditing 347 books in Classics library. This will take ~5 min (one fetch per
weak book). Continue?
```

Estimate time as `ceil(weak_book_count / 10)` minutes (assuming ~6 s per
fetch, 10 concurrent).  You don't know the weak count yet at this stage, so
use total book count as an upper bound.

---

### Step A2 — Scan pass (cheap — no API fetches)

Paginate through all books in scope using `GET /api/books?skip=<N>&limit=200`
(using `$URL` and `$TOKEN` from the selected profile).
For each book, classify as weak or strong based on the criteria above.  No
`fetch-metadata` calls in this pass.

**Series title-drift detection:** as you paginate, build a per-series map:
```
series_name → {title_pattern: count}
```
Where `title_pattern` is the book title with the series index replaced by `N`
(e.g. `"Tarzan, Vol. 3"` → `"Tarzan, Vol. N"`).  After all pages are
read, apply the **drift detection rule** (defined once here; referenced from
Step A5 and sibling-lookup Step 4b / Step U3):

**Case A — clear majority (≥80%):** if the top pattern covers ≥80% of books
in the series and ≥1 book deviates, mark the outliers as weak with reason
`"series title drift"`.  The majority pattern is the suggested canonical form.

**Case B — no majority, but inconsistent:** if no single pattern reaches 80%
(e.g. all three books use different separators or number formats), yet the
titles are clearly inconsistent (differing separators like `/`, `,`, ` `;
differing number tokens like `v`, `Vol.`, `Volume`, `#`; or mixed
zero-padding), mark **all** books in the series as weak with reason
`"series title drift — no majority"` and supply a suggested canonical format
based on `book_type`:
- `book_type` comics or graphic_novel → suggest `"<Series>, Vol. <N>"`
- `book_type` book with series_index → suggest `"<Series>, Vol. <N>"`
- `book_type` book (novels, non-series standalones) → do not auto-suggest;
  ask the user what pattern to use
- Unknown / mixed → ask the user

**Case C — all consistent:** all books share the same pattern; no action.

The rule applies to series with ≥3 books.  For series with 2 books, only
flag if the two titles use clearly incompatible formats (e.g. one uses `Vol.`
and the other uses `/`).

Exploit the existing `missing` filter param to accelerate the scan:

```bash
# Books missing cover
curl -sf -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "$URL/api/books?missing=cover&limit=200&skip=0"

# Books missing description
curl -sf -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "$URL/api/books?missing=description&limit=200&skip=0"
```

Run these concurrently to build the weak set faster.  For year (null), there
is no `missing=year` param — paginate normally and filter client-side.

**Critical gotcha — do NOT compute "missing description" from list responses.**
`GET /api/books` returns `BookOut`, which **omits the `description` field
entirely**.  If you iterate the list and check `item.get('description')`, every
book will look empty and you will report "N / N missing description" — a false
positive across the whole scope.  Always use `?missing=description` for this
signal, or fetch individual books via `GET /api/books/{id}` (which returns
`BookDetailOut` with the field populated).  The same applies to any other
`BookDetailOut`-only fields — prefer the `missing=*` filters for scan-time checks.

---

### Step A3 — Report before fetching

Print a summary of what the scan found, then ask for confirmation before any
`fetch-metadata` calls:

```
347 books scanned
  · 42 missing description
  · 18 missing year
  · 31 no cover
  · 6 series title drift
  68 unique weak books (some weak in multiple fields)

Proceed with candidate fetch on 68 weak books?
```

A book is counted once in the "unique weak books" total even if weak in
multiple fields.

Series title-drift cases are listed separately after the main counts.  Show
which drift case applies (A = clear majority, B = no majority):

```
Series title drift detected:
  "Tarzan"           [Case A] — 10 books use "Tarzan, Vol. N"; 1 uses "Tarzan vN"
  "Sherlock Holmes"  [Case A] — 8 books use "Sherlock Holmes Vol. N"; 2 use "Sherlock Holmes v N"
  "Barsoom"          [Case B] — 3 inconsistent patterns; suggested canonical: "Barsoom, Vol. N"
```

---

### Step A4 — Fetch, diff, apply

For each unique weak book, run the same fetch + score + diff loop as Update
mode Steps U4 and U5.  For books flagged as weak due to a missing or empty
description, apply the **web fallback for missing descriptions** (defined in
the ingest section) if the top fetch-metadata candidate's description is also
null, empty, or shorter than 200 characters.

Write a state file at `~/.cache/tome-scribe/.scribe-audit-<profile>-<timestamp>.json`
(same directory as update state files; create if missing) and persist after
each fetch so the run is resumable.  Including `<profile>` in the filename
ensures that resume checks only surface files for the currently-active profile.

State file schema (audit variant):

```json
{
  "mode": "audit",
  "profile": "<active profile name>",
  "scope": "<description of scope>",
  "run_at": "ISO timestamp",
  "total_scanned": 347,
  "weak_book_ids": [42, 55, 71],
  "books": [
    {
      "book_id": 42,
      "title": "Tarzan Vol. 1",
      "weak_reasons": ["no description", "no year"],
      "status": "pending|fetched|applied|skipped|error",
      "chosen_candidate_index": null,
      "diff": null,
      "error": null
    }
  ]
}
```

**Resume:** on start, check `~/.cache/tome-scribe/` for any
`.scribe-audit-<profile>-*.json` file (matching the current active profile)
with pending/fetched entries.  If found, offer to resume before re-scanning.
Ignore state files belonging to other profiles.

Stream progress while fetching:

```
Processing 1/68... 2/68... 3/68...
```

After all fetches complete, show the same compact diff format as Update mode
Step U5.  Then prompt for bulk resolution with the same option syntax
(`"accept all"`, `"skip #N"`, `"show #N"`, `"cancel"`).

---

### Step A5 — Series title drift (always surface for review, never auto-apply)

Title drift is handled separately from the main apply step, regardless of
candidate confidence scores.  Even a perfect confidence score does not
auto-apply a title change.

After the main apply step, present drift cases one at a time.  For Case A
(clear majority), show only the outliers.  For Case B (no majority), show
every book in the series alongside the suggested canonical form; let the user
accept, edit, or skip:

Case A example:
```
Series 'Sherlock Holmes' [Case A] — 8 books use "Sherlock Holmes Vol. N"; 2 use "Sherlock Holmes v N"
Outliers:
  #id=71  "Sherlock Holmes v 2"  → normalize to "Sherlock Holmes Vol. 2"?
  #id=83  "Sherlock Holmes v 5"  → normalize to "Sherlock Holmes Vol. 5"?
Normalize these outliers? [y/n/show]
```

Case B example:
```
Series 'Barsoom' [Case B] — 3 inconsistent patterns (no majority)
Suggested canonical: "Barsoom, Vol. N"  (series convention)
All books:
  #id=10  "Barsoom /1"    → "Barsoom, Vol. 1"
  #id=11  "Barsoom/2"     → "Barsoom, Vol. 2"
  #id=12  "Barsoom/3"     → "Barsoom, Vol. 3"
Accept suggested pattern, edit it, or skip? [accept/edit <new pattern>/skip]
```

If the user chooses `edit <new pattern>`, substitute that pattern for all
books in the series (replacing `N` with each book's `series_index`).

Never auto-apply in either case — always wait for explicit user confirmation.

- `y` → apply via `PUT /api/books/{id}` with `{"title": "<normalized>"}` for
  each outlier (using `$URL` and `$TOKEN` from the selected profile).
- `n` → skip this series, move to next.
- `show` → print all book titles in the series for context, then re-prompt.

Use `PUT /api/books/{id}` (not `apply-metadata`) for title-only corrections,
since `apply-metadata` triggers a full metadata merge and may overwrite other
fields.

### Step A6 — Final summary

```
Audit complete. 347 scanned · 68 weak · 51 updated · 12 skipped · 5 errors
Series drift: 3 series normalized, 1 skipped.
```

Delete the state file on clean completion.

---

## Step S — `/scribe series <name>` — series metadata

Fill series-level metadata — publication status and story arcs — from Claude's
own knowledge.  A required confirm-diff step precedes every write.

### Trigger forms

- `/scribe series Berserk`
- `/scribe series "A Certain Magical Index"`
- "fill arcs for berserk"
- "set series status for One Piece"
- "add arc data to the Berserk series"

Profile selection (Step 0d) applies before any API call is made.

---

### Step S1 — Resolve the series

Parse the series name out of the command (strip quotes if present).
URL-encode the name for use in API calls.

Confirm the series exists in the library and gather its volumes:

```bash
curl -sf -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "$URL/api/books?series=<url-encoded-name>&limit=500" \
  > /tmp/scribe_series_books.json
```

Extract the list of `{id, title, series_index}` from the response.
Sort by `series_index` ascending.

If zero books are returned, abort:
`"No books found for series '<name>'. Check the series name and try again."`

Print nothing else at this stage.

---

### Step S2 — Read existing metadata

Fetch current series state in parallel:

```bash
# Meta (status)
curl -sf -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "$URL/api/series/<url-encoded-name>/meta" \
  > /tmp/scribe_series_meta.json

# Arcs
curl -sf -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "$URL/api/series/<url-encoded-name>/arcs" \
  > /tmp/scribe_series_arcs.json
```

Record `existing_status` (from meta) and `existing_arcs` (from arcs, may be
an empty list).

---

### Step S3 — Handle existing arcs

If `existing_arcs` is non-empty, prompt the user before generating a proposal:

```
This series already has N arc(s):
  #1  <arc name>  Vol. <start>–<end>
  ...
Replace all / merge (keep existing, add proposed as new names only) / abort?
```

Wait for the user's choice before continuing.

- **Replace all** — the proposal will replace every existing arc.
- **Merge** — existing arcs are carried through verbatim into the payload; the
  proposal only adds arcs whose names do not already exist.  Because
  `POST /api/series/{name}/arcs/bulk` deletes any arc absent from the payload,
  merge mode must include existing entries unchanged alongside any new ones.
- **Abort** — print `"Aborted. No changes written."` and stop.

If `existing_arcs` is empty, skip this step entirely.

---

### Step S4 — LLM proposal

Claude generates a proposal from its own knowledge of the series.  No external
API calls are made at this step.

Required shape:
```json
{
  "status": "ongoing" | "finished" | "hiatus" | "unknown",
  "arcs": [
    {
      "name": "Arc Name",
      "start_index": 1.0,
      "end_index": 2.0,
      "description": "One short sentence or null."
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules:

- **Confidence gate:** if Claude does not have confident, specific knowledge of
  this series (cannot name at least the major arcs and their approximate volume
  ranges), refuse and stop:
  `"I don't have confident knowledge of '<name>' — please add arcs manually via the Tome UI."`
  Do not attempt a partial or guessed proposal.
- `status: "unknown"` is acceptable when the current publication state is
  genuinely unclear.
- `arcs` may be an empty array `[]` only if the series is a standalone work
  with no distinct story arcs.  If this is the case, state it explicitly:
  `"<name> has no distinct arcs — only status will be set."` and show the
  status diff only (Step S5).
- Arc `start_index` and `end_index` must be floats matching Tome's
  `series_index` type (e.g. `1.0`, `13.5`).
- Descriptions: one sentence, under 200 characters.  Describe the arc's
  premise without spoiling major plot resolutions.  Use `null` if no neutral
  one-sentence summary is possible.

Do not print the proposal JSON.  Proceed to Step S5.

---

### Step S5 — Present diff

Render the proposal side-by-side with existing state in a compact, human-readable
block:

```
Series: Berserk
Status:   unknown → ongoing

Arcs (new):
  #1  Black Swordsman      Vol. 1.0–2.0    Guts' lone hunts for apostles.
  #2  Golden Age           Vol. 3.0–14.0   Flashback: origin of the Band of the Hawk.
  #3  Conviction           Vol. 14.0–21.0  Guts' journey through a war-torn land.
  #4  Falcon of the Millennium Empire  Vol. 22.0–35.0  Griffith reborn and war on two fronts.
  #5  Fantasia             Vol. 35.0–41.0  The world transformed; Guts' final pursuit.
```

If Step S3 was "merge", label the section:
```
Arcs (merged — existing kept, additions shown with *):
  #1  Black Swordsman  Vol. 1.0–2.0   [existing]
  #2  Golden Age       Vol. 3.0–14.0  [existing]
  #3  Lost Children    Vol. 14.0–17.0 * (new)
```

**Mismatch / gap flags (print below the arc list; do not abort):**

- If the proposal's maximum `end_index` is less than the library's maximum
  `series_index`, list the unaccounted volumes:
  `"Library has Vol. up to X; proposal ends at Y — unassigned: Vol. Z1, Z2, ..."`
- If any library `series_index` value falls between two arc ranges (a gap) or
  beyond the last arc:
  `"Vol. X.5 is in the library but falls outside all proposed arcs."`
- These warnings are informational only.  The user decides whether to adjust.

If `status` is unchanged (existing equals proposed), omit the Status line.
If arcs is empty (standalone work), omit the Arcs block entirely.

---

### Step S6 — Confirm and apply

After the diff, prompt:

```
Apply? ("yes"/"apply", row-level correction, or "no"/"abort")
```

**"yes" / "apply":**

1. Write status:
```bash
curl -sf -X PUT "$URL/api/series/<url-encoded-name>/meta" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "<proposed_status>"}'
```

2. Write arcs (skip if arcs array is empty):
```bash
curl -sf -X POST "$URL/api/series/<url-encoded-name>/arcs/bulk" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '<arcs array JSON>'
```

   In merge mode, include existing arcs verbatim in the array alongside any
   new ones, so the bulk endpoint does not delete them.

3. On HTTP 403 for either call: `"Permission denied — the active token is not
   admin. No changes written."` and stop.

4. On success, print one line:
   `"Applied: status=<status>, <N> arcs."`
   (If only status was changed and arcs were empty: `"Applied: status=<status>."`)

**Row-level correction** — the user modifies the proposal in natural language
before applying.  Examples:
- `"change arc 3 end to 20"` → update `end_index` on arc #3 in the in-memory
  proposal
- `"drop arc 5"` → remove arc #5 from the proposal
- `"rename #2 to Lost Children Arc"` → update `name` on arc #2
- `"set start of arc 4 to 22.5"` → update `start_index` on arc #4

Parse the correction, update the in-memory proposal, re-render only the changed
rows plus a one-line summary of what changed, then re-prompt for confirmation:

```
Updated arc #3: end_index 14.0 → 20.0
Re-confirm? ("yes"/"apply", further corrections, or "no"/"abort")
```

Corrections may be chained — keep accepting corrections and re-prompting until
the user says "yes"/"apply" or "no"/"abort".

**"no" / "abort":**
`"Aborted. No changes written."` and stop.

---

### Cross-cutting rules for series mode

- **Output discipline:** terse throughout.  Never echo the proposal JSON.
  The diff in Step S5 is the only substantive human-readable output.  All other
  messages are one-line status, prompts, or warnings.
- **Writes require admin.** A 403 from either write endpoint must be surfaced
  cleanly as `"Permission denied — the active token is not admin."` — do not
  retry or fall back silently.
- **Step S3 merge invariant:** when merge mode is active, the arcs payload
  sent to `POST .../arcs/bulk` must always contain the full set of arcs that
  should exist after the call — existing arcs included verbatim, new arcs
  appended.  Never send a partial payload in merge mode.
- **No state file for series mode.** The workflow is interactive and short
  enough that a crash-resumable state file adds complexity without benefit.
  If something goes wrong, the user simply re-runs `/scribe series <name>`.

---

## Shared conventions for update and audit modes

- Both modes use the **candidate scoring heuristic** table defined above (in
  the ingest section) without modification.  Do not redefine or adjust the
  scoring at runtime.
- Both modes use the **pinned-fields logic** from Step 4b and "Respecting
  pinned fields at apply time" (Step 6) in the ingest workflow.
- Both modes use the same **output discipline**: terse by default; verbose
  drill-down only on explicit user request ("show #N", "verbose").
- State files for both modes live in `~/.cache/tome-scribe/` (create if
  missing).  They are **not** placed in any book directory or the Tome data
  dir.
- `book_type_id` is **not** a filter param on `GET /api/books`.  To narrow by
  book type, resolve the type's `library_id` from `GET /api/book-types` and
  use `library_id=<id>` instead.
- Title-only corrections (drift normalization) use `PUT /api/books/{id}` with
  a body containing just `{"title": "<new>"}`.  Field-level metadata updates
  (description, year, cover, tags, etc.) use
  `POST /api/books/{id}/apply-metadata`.

---

## Error handling reminders

- If `extract.py` exits non-zero, show stderr and stop.
- If Tome returns 401 on any call, tell the user their token may be expired
  or wrong, and offer to re-run Step 0 for the active profile.
- If a single ingest call fails with a non-409 error, log it and continue —
  never abort the batch.
- If `/tmp` fills up, warn and stop before corrupting state.
