"""Build the showcase database used for marketing screenshots.

Run from the repo root:

    python scripts/seed_showcase.py

Creates:
    data/showcase/tome.db        Fresh SQLite, seeded.
    data/showcase/covers/        Cover JPEGs (copied from docs/seed/covers/)
    library/showcase/            Empty (placeholder paths only — no real ebook files)

Then point a Tome backend at this dir:

    TOME_SECRET_KEY=dev TOME_DATA_DIR=./data/showcase \
      TOME_LIBRARY_DIR=./library/showcase TOME_INCOMING_DIR=./bindery/showcase \
      python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --port 8090 --reload

The seed is deterministic — random.seed is fixed, so re-running produces
identical data. Idempotent: drops + recreates the DB on every run.
