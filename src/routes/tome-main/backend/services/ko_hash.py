"""KOReader partial-MD5: compute and record device-matchable file identities.

KOReader identifies a book by ``util.partialMD5`` — an MD5 over 1 KB samples
taken at exponentially spaced offsets — not by a full-content hash. This module
is a byte-exact Python port plus the recording helpers that keep the
``ko_hashes`` table current (see the model docstring for why raw and baked
artifacts are hashed separately).

Port notes (KOReader ``frontend/util.lua:1111``):
- the loop runs i = -1 .. 10 with ``bit.lshift(1024, 2*i)``; LuaJIT masks the
  shift amount to 5 bits, so i = -1 becomes a shift by 30 whose 32-bit result
  is 0 — i.e. the first sample is at offset 0, then 1024 << (2*i) for i >= 0
  (1 KB, 4 KB, 16 KB, … 1 GB).
- ``file:read(1024)`` returns nil only at EOF; a short read near EOF is still
  hashed. Python's ``read()`` returning ``b""`` maps exactly onto the nil case.
