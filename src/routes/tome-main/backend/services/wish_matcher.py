"""Wish matcher — finds open wishes that match a newly added book, and
(reverse direction) finds existing books that match an open wish.

Forward strategies (book just added → find matching wishes):
1. ISBN exact — strong.
2. Series + index — strong (single-volume wish only; series-wishes stay open).
3. Title + author fuzzy (SequenceMatcher > 0.85) — weak, suggestion only.

Reverse strategies (wish just created → find matching books already in library):
1. ISBN exact — strong.
2. Whole-series wish — books where series matches OR title starts with series name.
3. Single-volume series wish — books where series+index both match exactly.
4. Standalone fuzzy — title+author SequenceMatcher > 0.85 (only when cheaper
   strategies found nothing; scans the full library but caps results).

The matcher NEVER auto-fulfils. It populates Wish.suggested_book_ids so the
admin fulfil-panel can surface "this satisfies Maya's wish — Fulfill?".
