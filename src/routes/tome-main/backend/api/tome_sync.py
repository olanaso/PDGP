# Plugin versioning. BUILD is the ONLY value compared for self-update (monotonic
# integer — bump on every plugin code change). SEMVER is human-facing display.
# VERSION is kept as a back-compat alias (= str(BUILD)) for old plugins and the
# web UI, which read `version` from /plugin/version.
# BUILD 14: the HTTPS-sync fix also shipped as 1.2.1 (BUILD 13, cut from the
# v1.2.0 tag). main's impl carries more than 1.2.1's, so it must take a *higher*
# build than 13 — otherwise a device that updated to 1.2.1's build-13 impl and
# later points at a main/1.3.0 server (also 13) would not re-download main's
# richer impl. Hence 14.
# BUILD 31: half-star ratings — rating_baseline entries split into
# {remote, device} so a Tome half-star rounded onto the whole-star sidecar is
# never pushed back as a "local edit" (old {rating=...} entries migrate on read).
# BUILD 32: hygiene batch — clock-offset guard (device_time on annotation syncs;
# server-minted stamps shifted into the device frame; future-stamp clamps),
# pull-conflict strategy settings (forward/backward × prompt/silent/never), and
# a dedicated tomesync_state.lua for the data tables (migrated out of
# G_reader_settings, pruned for books no longer on disk).
# BUILD 36: shelves axis — the device browser gains a Shelves entry backed by
# GET /tome-sync/{shelves,shelf-books}; shelf params resolve server-side via
# the device-supported subset of the dashboard filters (drift-checked against
# /books in tests). Mixed lists download by each book's own identity.
# BUILD 33: catalog batch — device search (submit-based + recent searches),
# author browse axis, read-status write-back (hold a book row); the shared
# _bookListMenu drill-down shows per-book status markers. Server side: series
# list N+1 fixed, /tome-sync/{authors,author-books,search} + PUT status.
# BUILD 34: library sweep — "Sync closed books" walks the device for books
# TomeSync never synced, resolves them by partial-MD5 in batches
# (POST /tome-sync/match-hashes) and adopts each sidecar's status/rating/
# progress via the fill-gaps-only POST /tome-sync/sweep/{book_id}. Ack-gated
# ledger keyed by sidecar mtime → resumable, re-run-safe.
# BUILD 35: sync on suspend (issue #128) — opt-in catch-up of pending
# sessions/ratings + reading-history backfill when the device sleeps, with an
# aggressive variant that turns WiFi on first (turnOnWifiAndWaitForConnection,
# bypassing wifi_enable_action so "prompt" never dialogs onto the sleep
# screen). onNetworkConnected also runs the history backfill now (was
# launch-only) and no longer requires an open book to flush pending state.
# BUILD 39: "Sync now" pulls before it pushes (issue #175) — the server
# position runs through the same forward/backward pull-conflict strategy as
# book open, so a device that is behind no longer overwrites newer progress
# from another device; the push happens after the pull settles. Pairs with the
# server-side TOME_KOSYNC_POSITION_BRIDGE read bridge (experimental, off by
# default), which lets that pull also see third-party KOSync client pushes.
# BUILD 41: device-side connection settings (#181, #185) — baked server URL /
# API key / username become DEFAULT_* fallbacks overridable in Settings. The
# server URL is user-editable (a device whose baked URL went stale cannot
# self-update its way out, so the fix must live on the device); the API key is
# never typed — "Sign in with code" runs the existing Quick Connect flow
# (initiate → code entered in web UI → poll → JWT → mint plugin API key); the
# username is display-only, derived from /auth/me at pairing time. Plus an
# input_hint fix (ghost text never showed; the field was misnamed "hint") and
# a settings-menu reorder. Co-developed with @pabsan-0.

    (3) is the fix for HTTPS-behind-a-proxy deployments: a TLS-terminating proxy
    makes the app server see ``http``, so ``request.base_url`` would bake an
    ``http://`` URL; if the proxy then redirects HTTP→HTTPS, KOReader can't
    follow the 307 on POST/PUT and every session/position sync fails. Honouring
    the forwarded scheme bakes ``https`` instead. When the header is absent
    (plain HTTP / LAN / localhost) the scheme is left untouched, so those
    deployments bake exactly what they did before.

-- ── Rating sync (bidirectional, per open book) ───────────────────────────────
-- KOReader's native Book status screen stores a 1–5 star rating + a free-text
-- review in the per-book sidecar under `summary` (`rating` / `note`). Tome holds
-- the same per-user rating/review on UserBookStatus. We mirror both directions
-- using a saved baseline to tell which side changed since the last reconcile:
--   only device changed  -> push device → Tome
--   only Tome changed     -> write Tome → device sidecar
--   both changed (tie)    -> Tome wins (single source of truth)
-- `summary.status` (reading/complete/abandoned) is left untouched — reading
-- status already syncs via TomeSyncPosition.
--
-- Half-stars (build 31): Tome ratings can be 4.5 etc.; KOReader's sidecar is
-- whole-star, so a pulled half-star is rounded to the NEAREST star for the
-- device (halves round up: 4.5 → 5). The baseline
-- therefore keeps TWO values per book — `remote` (Tome's exact value) and
-- `device` (what we wrote to the sidecar) — so the rounded copy is never
-- mistaken for a local edit and pushed back (which would destroy the half-star
-- server-side). Old single-value baselines ({{rating=...}}) migrate on read.

-- ── Metadata sync (Tome → device) ────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Writes Tome's metadata into KOReader's own custom-metadata sidecar
-- (custom_metadata.lua + cover.<ext> next to the .sdr) — the same override
-- layer that Book information > Edit fills in by hand. The book file itself
-- is never touched, so its partial-MD5 identity, reading position and sidecar
-- state all stay put; deleting the sidecar file restores the file's own
-- metadata.
--
-- Safety: the server answers ONLY for (book_id, partial-MD5) pairs it has on
-- record for that exact book (hashed when Tome scanned or served the file).
-- A filename-heuristic resolve, a different edition or a sideloaded file it
-- never saw is rejected server-side, so one book's metadata can never land
-- on another file.
--
-- Per-file ledger (dedicated state file, pruned with book_map):
--   path -> {{ id=, md5=, size=, mtime=, fp=, keys={{...}} }}
-- md5/size/mtime skip re-hashing files that have not changed; fp is the
-- server's content fingerprint (a match = nothing to do, nothing sent);
-- keys = which custom_props we own, so a field Tome later clears falls back
-- to the file's embedded value instead of sticking.
