# Changelog

All notable changes to Tome are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). This project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- TomeSync metadata sync (Tome -> KOReader), issue #210. Metadata edited in
  Tome - title, author, series and index, language, tags, description and
  cover - is written into KOReader's own custom metadata for the books on
  the device, so Tome is the source of truth for what the device shows.
  The book files themselves are never modified: the plugin writes the same
  `custom_metadata.lua` sidecar and custom cover that Book information >
  Edit does, so reading position, sidecar state and file identity stay put,
  and KOReader's own "reset" still restores the file's embedded values.
  Only books Tome can verify by file hash are touched (a file that never
  passed through Tome, or a different edition, is left alone). Opt-in per
  device via Settings > "Apply Tome metadata to this device"; runs shortly
  after launch and when WiFi connects, and on demand via "Apply Tome
  metadata now", which shows progress while it runs. Steady-state runs send
  nothing but fingerprints. Plugin build 45 / 1.15.3.

### Fixed
- Library scans no longer fail when two byte-identical files are picked up
  in one run. The second copy queued the same KOReader file hash again
  inside the scan's single transaction, the database's uniqueness check
  rejected it at commit, and the whole scan rolled back - every book that
  scan had just added vanished from Tome while its files stayed in the
  library. Contributed by @obitheway (#215).
- The per-book caps on baked KOReader hashes and on reading-position history
  are now exact. Both prunes ran before the newly added row was written and
  so kept one entry too many (6 instead of 5 hashes, 41 instead of 40
  history entries).

## [2.4.0] - 2026-09-03

### Changed
- Smoother interface motion throughout the web app. Dialogs now animate
  out as well as in, the notification dropdown pops from its corner, and
  books gliding to their new grid positions on filter or size changes now
  also fade in and out as they enter and leave the results. Honours the
  system "reduce motion" preference.

### Fixed
- Reading streaks (and every day-bucketed stat) now handle daylight-saving
  time correctly. Day bucketing used the browser's current UTC offset for
  all of history, so a session started between 3 and 4 AM local time in the
  opposite DST regime landed on the wrong day - a single winter bedtime
  read could silently cut a months-long streak, and the streak number
  changed at each clock change. The web app now sends its IANA timezone
  alongside the offset and the server buckets each timestamp against the
  timezone's real transition history. Clients that only send an offset
  (KOReader plugin, external API users) keep the previous behaviour.
- OPDS search returns results again. The OpenSearch description pointed
  readers at the descriptor URL instead of the results feed, so a search from
  an OPDS client got the description document back and showed nothing. Thanks
  @ziozzang. (#193)

### Added
- Per-user content restrictions, set by an admin in Admin → Users. Hidden
  tags make books carrying any of the listed tags (matched
  case-insensitively) invisible to that user everywhere - browsing, search,
  filters, OPDS and the KOReader plugin - including the user's own uploads.
  A downloads-per-day limit caps how many files the account can fetch per
  UTC day (0 disables downloads entirely, blank means unlimited), enforced
  on every download path: single file, bulk ZIP, OPDS and TomeSync. Admin
  accounts are never restricted. (#190)
- Reader tap zones are now configurable. A "Tap zones" setting in the EPUB
  and comic readers' settings panel offers Default (tap right for next page),
  Swapped (tap left for next - for reading one-handed with the device in the
  left hand), and Off (turn pages by swipe only). RTL comics keep advancing
  in their reading direction; swipes and arrow keys are unaffected. (#192)
- The TomeSync plugin's connection settings are now editable on the device
  (plugin build 41). The server URL baked in at download time can be changed
  under TomeSync → Settings — the fix for a device stranded by a server that
  moved address, which could never self-update its way out. Credentials are
  never typed on the device: "Sign in with code" runs the existing Quick
  Connect flow (enter a short code in the web UI under Settings → Security →
  Quick Connect) and the device receives its own API key; the account name
  shown is derived from that key. A reset item restores the baked-in
  defaults. Also fixes the device-name dialog's ghost text, which never
  showed. Thanks @pabsan-0 for the initial implementation. (#181, #185)
- Backlog completion estimates: how long a book you haven't started would
  take at your own pace, and how long a whole pile would. The book page gets
  an "Est. read time" cell in Details (word count at your measured words per
  minute, or your average time per finished book of that type when there is
  no word count - CBZ and PDF), the series page shows "left in this series"
  over the unstarted volumes, and Stats → Library has a new Backlog tile with
  a per-type breakdown. The tile's scope - Want to Read, all unread, a
  library or a shelf - is picked in the tile's edit-mode settings. Days are
  derived from your minutes-per-day over the last 30 days (90 when the last
  month was quiet); books Tome can't estimate yet are counted as "not
  estimated" rather than guessed. The series Reading Stats block no longer
  shows its own "Est. remaining", the header line replaces it. (#187)
- Language picker in Settings → Appearance. The web UI is now translatable:
  source strings stay in English, translations live in `frontend/src/locales/`
  and are community-maintained (see `docs/translating.md`). Anything not yet
  translated falls back to English. Ships with a Simplified Chinese (zh-CN)
  catalog that is just getting started; the KOReader plugin and the website
  stay English for now. (#183)

## [2.3.0] - 2026-08-20

![Series-first Bindery review: two pending series cards, one adopting the exact identity of a series already in the library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bndct-devops/tome/main/docs/screenshots/bindery-series-review.png)

### Added
- Experimental KOSync position bridge (`TOME_KOSYNC_POSITION_BRIDGE`, off by
  default) — with it enabled, a device running the TomeSync plugin picks up
  reading progress pushed by third-party KOSync clients (Crosspoint, Readest,
  stock KOReader sync) on the same book. The bridge is read-only: KOSync
  pushes still never overwrite plugin or web positions on the server; the
  plugin's pull just sees whichever known position is newest. Since KOSync
  clients send no resolvable locator, the jump lands at the right percentage,
  not the exact line. Marked experimental until it has seen real multi-client
  use. (#175)
- The Docker image now honours `PUID` / `PGID` (LinuxServer.io convention) to
  run Tome as the host user that owns your mounts. Defaults to `1000:1000`,
  which is exactly what the image did before, so existing installs need no
  changes. Set them to your NAS docker user on Synology / QNAP / TrueNAS,
  where ACLs are granted to that user rather than to uid 1000. On start the
  entrypoint also fixes ownership of `/data` (never `/books` or `/bindery`),
  so switching UID on an existing install no longer breaks on the 0600
  `secret.key`. Compose files that already pass `user:` keep working. (#177)

### Fixed
- Reading time from a second device no longer vanishes when another device
  syncs its KOReader reading history for the same book. Imported history used
  to supersede *every* live device session on that book; it now supersedes
  only the sessions it actually describes (the sittings its page timings
  overlap in time), so a week of phone reading stays counted after a Kindle
  uploads two evenings of the same title. Existing data is fixed on upgrade
  with no action needed; live sessions also count as normal until their own
  device's history sync catches up, instead of dropping out early. (#181)
- KOReader plugin (build 40 / 1.13.0): every device used to report the
  literal name "KOReader", so all of a user's devices shared one
  reading-history sync position and were indistinguishable in the reading
  log. The plugin now reports the device model (`KindlePaperWhite4`,
  `Kobo_clara`, ...) or a name you set under TomeSync → Settings → Device
  name, and carries its imported history and sync position over to the new
  name on first sync - nothing is re-sent or duplicated, and the sync is
  postponed rather than restarted from scratch if the server has not
  confirmed the move. Live sessions recorded before the update keep their
  old label. One caveat for setups where two devices both synced history
  under the shared old name: the first device to update takes over that
  history's label; the second re-sends its own history once (deduplicated,
  so no double counting), which does bring back any of its imported
  sittings you had deleted in Tome. Update via Check for updates as usual.
  (#181)
- Bindery accept and auto-import no longer leave an orphaned copy in the
  library when the file can be copied into `/books` but not deleted from
  `/bindery` (a permission failure on the source, as on Synology ACLs that
  allow create but not delete). Previously every retry produced another
  `Title (2).epub` with no book record; the half-finished copy is now removed
  before the error is reported. (#177)
- Starting Tome as a different UID than the one that created `/data` now
  fails with a message that names the fix (PUID/PGID, chown, or
  `TOME_SECRET_KEY`) instead of a bare `PermissionError` traceback on
  `secret.key`. (#177)
- Bindery review now recognises series you already own: when a pending file's
  series matches existing volumes, the review proposes their exact spelling,
  author, book type and libraries (volumes a human has reviewed outvote
  unreviewed ones), ending series-name drift like "Frieren - Beyond Journey's
  End" arriving next to "Frieren: Beyond Journey's End". The proposal is
  always editable and only applies when you accept - unattended auto-import
  deliberately keeps its hands off.

- Bindery review is now series-first: pending files group into series cards
  where name, author, book type and libraries are decided once for the whole
  group, volumes are confirmed as chips, and a destination-folder preview
  shows where the files will land. When the series already exists in the
  library the card adopts its exact identity and says so ("In library - 3
  vols - reviewed"), so a drift-named batch files under the existing spelling
  in one click. Loose files keep the flat list and per-file review flow.

### Changed
- Auto-import now applies external metadata in three confidence tiers instead
  of two: a strong match applies fully as before, a middling one only fills
  gaps in description, publisher and year, and a weak one is discarded
  entirely - previously a wrong match could still plant its ISBN, tags and
  cover on a metadata-poor file even when the title/author guard held.

### Fixed
- Books accepted through the Bindery review flow now count as reviewed.
  Previously they were created with the flag unset, so a human-confirmed
  volume still appeared in the unreviewed queue and didn't count as
  authoritative when new volumes of the same series inherit their identity.
- "Sync now" in the TomeSync plugin (build 39) now pulls the server position
  before pushing, using the same forward/backward conflict strategy as book
  open. Previously it only pushed, so tapping it on a device that was behind
  overwrote newer progress from another device. (#175)
- The Home tab no longer flashes a false "Nothing in progress" empty state
  while it loads. Sections now hydrate behind skeleton placeholders and mount
  in one paint, cutting the cold-load layout shift from "poor" (CLS 0.27) to
  "good" (0.04) - content stops jumping down as data arrives.
- Cold starts no longer show a blank white page while the app downloads: the
  page ships a minimal theme-aware splash (your stored theme's background and
  the Tome mark), so slow connections and PWA updates get a branded loading
  state instead of a void - and dark-theme users no longer get a white flash.
- The UI fonts are now bundled with the app instead of loaded from the Google
  Fonts CDN. Air-gapped and privacy-conscious installs render the real
  typefaces with no third-party request.
- On phones, the Stats hour-by-day heatmap signals that it scrolls: edge fades
  now hint at the evening columns that were silently cut off after ~4pm.
- The Session Timeline tile no longer shows a wall of empty card below a
  sparse window - rows center vertically and a caption states how many active
  days the window covers.
- Stats charts wait for their tile to be laid out before rendering, fixing the
  skipped first paint and the "width(-1)" console warnings on every visit.
- Series pages no longer draw clipped "ghost" bars for unread volumes in the
  time-per-volume chart - unread volumes are a hairline tick on the baseline.
- Series with no cover art no longer fire a failing cover request on every
  grid render; the series list now points at the first volume that actually
  has a cover, or none at all.
- Home carousels (Continue Reading, Recently Finished, Recently Added, Pick up
  where you left off) show edge fades and an always-visible scroll chevron
  while covers continue past the edge, instead of silently clipping the last
  card - the fade alone was invisible over dark artwork, and at widths where
  the cutoff fell between two cards there was no signal at all.
- Tap targets that were far below the platform minimum are now comfortably
  tappable on phones: book-page breadcrumbs, prev/next volume arrows, the
  sidebar's "new library" button, the password-reveal eye, and the book-page
  action row.
- The Highlights search box gets its own full-width row on phones instead of
  shrinking to an unusable sliver next to the filter buttons.
- The Admin tab bar hints that it scrolls on phones (edge fades, and the
  active tab keeps itself in view) - eight of its thirteen tabs were invisible
  with no affordance.
- Bindery's refresh button keeps its label on phones; collapsed to a bare icon
  it sat next to the global sync indicator as two identical glyphs.
- Hardcover match cards no longer repeat the volume number when the title
  already carries it ("Berserk, Vol. 1 · Vol. 1").
- Upcoming releases shows the standard book placeholder instead of a bare gray
  square when a followed series has no cover art yet.
- Native dropdowns in the Admin area now match the app's input styling, and
  the narrow admin tabs (Scanner, Server) center like the rest.
- The three Home stat chips wrap as three even columns on phones instead of a
  ragged two-plus-one.
- The Stats empty state now mentions all three ways sessions arrive (TomeSync
  plugin, manual logging, KOReader import) instead of implying the plugin is
  required.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-08-09

### Security
- Updated `pdfjs-dist` to 6.2.108, clearing an arbitrary-JavaScript-execution
  advisory triggered by opening a malicious PDF (GHSA / CVE for PDF.js). This
  one is real in Tome: the web reader renders library PDFs with PDF.js in the
  app's origin, so a crafted PDF opened in the reader could run script with
  access to the session. Anyone hosting PDFs for multiple users should update.
- Updated `fast-uri` (build-time, via vite-plugin-pwa's workbox tooling) to
  3.1.5, clearing a host-confusion advisory. Not reachable in Tome - it only
  parses our own build configuration during `vite build`.
- Updated `js-yaml` to 4.3.1 in the frontend (dev-only, eslint's config
  loader) and the website build, clearing a quadratic-CPU advisory. Neither
  parses untrusted input.
- Updated `postcss` to 8.5.26 in the website build, picking up the completed
  fix for the source-map advisory partially addressed in v2.1.1. Build-time
  only, same as before.

### Added
- New "Want to Read" reading status — the missing state between the wishlist
  and actually starting a book: owned, not started, queued next. Set it from
  the book page (next to Shelved), filter by it on the dashboard, and it
  self-promotes to Reading the moment real progress arrives from KOReader or
  the web reader. Series "continue" suggestions prefer a queued volume over a
  plain unread one, and the Library Completion stats tile shows a queued
  count. When an admin fulfils your wish, the arriving book lands on your
  Want to Read automatically — the intent that created the wish carries over
  (never overwriting a book you're already reading). Volumes arriving for a
  followed series do the same.
- Hardcover sync now covers Want to Read — in both directions. Queueing a
  book in Tome shelves it as "Want to Read" on your Hardcover profile, and
  books you shelve on Hardcover appear as Want to Read in Tome (for books
  Tome has matched to the Hardcover catalogue). Removing a book from the
  Hardcover shelf reverts it in Tome only when both sides had agreed on it;
  a book you're actively reading in Tome is never touched, and ratings and
  progress remain push-only as before. Shelving a book Tome doesn't have at
  all creates a wish on your Tome wishlist instead (with cover and author from
  the Hardcover catalogue), un-shelving it on Hardcover dismisses that wish
  again, and re-shelving it reopens the same wish. A shelved book that is
  already in the library but was never catalogue-matched adopts its match
  straight from the shelf entry and lands queued, instead of being skipped.
- Library Health now detects orphaned entries — books whose files no longer
  exist on disk (for example after files were deleted or moved outside of
  Tome). A new section lists them and a one-click "Remove Dead Entries" action
  cleans them up: dead file entries are removed and books left with no files
  at all are deleted entirely. Entries whose file still exists are never
  touched. (#165)
- Duplicates (Admin) gained a "Delete Others" action: keep the selected book
  and delete the other copies in the group, including their files on disk,
  with an inline confirmation step. Files that are missing from disk are now
  badged as such on each duplicate, so dead copies are easy to spot. (#165)
- New `POST /api/books/bulk-delete` endpoint deletes several books in one
  request with per-book permission checks and error reporting. The dashboard's
  multi-select delete now uses it instead of issuing one request per book,
  and failures are reported instead of silently skipped. (#165)
- The Duplicates tab now works in one pass: pick the book to keep and an
  action (Merge, Delete Others, Dismiss) per group, then hit a single "Apply
  All" — instead of the screen refreshing and resetting your selections after
  every individual merge or dismiss. A summary reports what was applied and
  any failures. (#165)

### Fixed
- The Hardcover shelf sync's first cycle could wrongly dismiss open series
  follows and user-created wishes whose metadata came from Hardcover (they
  share the "hardcover" source marker with wishes the sync creates). The
  shelf mirror now only ever touches wishes it created itself, and on the
  first start after updating, wrongly-dismissed follows and wishes are
  reopened automatically — admin-dismissed wishes stay closed.
- OPDS feed links now carry the correct public scheme behind a TLS-terminating
  reverse proxy. The feed built its links from the request as the app server
  saw it — plain http — so every navigation, download, and cover link came out
  as `http://` even when the catalog was reached over https. OPDS now resolves
  the public origin the same way the KOReader plugin URL and OIDC redirect do:
  `TOME_PUBLIC_URL` when set, otherwise the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header. (#167)
- KOReader plugin (build 38 / 1.11.1): popup menus — the series browser,
  Authors, Shelves, the Inbox and the TomeSync menu itself — could freeze on
  their first page when a full-screen home-screen plugin (such as
  bookshelf.koplugin) covers the file browser: page turns happened internally
  but the screen never repainted, and stale refreshes could leave blank white
  rectangles behind. The menus now repaint through their own window instead of
  the hidden file browser.
- "Select all" on the dashboard now selects every book matching the current
  filters, not just the ones the infinite scroll had already loaded — so bulk
  actions on large libraries no longer silently miss the books further down.
  (#165)
- Toggling "Group series" no longer occasionally shows duplicate books in the
  grid: an in-flight page request from the previous view could land after the
  toggle and append stale results onto the fresh list. Page requests are now
  cancelled when the view changes, and appends are deduplicated. (#165)
- Merging duplicates now actually transfers the removed book's files to the
  kept book. Previously the transferred file entries were silently deleted
  together with the removed book, leaving the files on disk untracked.
- Merging duplicates no longer carries dead file references over to the kept
  book: entries whose file is missing from disk are dropped during the merge
  instead of leaving the kept book with a file that errors on open. (#165)

## [2.1.1] - 2026-08-01

### Security
- Updated `react-router` to 7.18.2, clearing four advisories: an unauthenticated
  route-matching DoS (CVE-2026-55685), an open redirect via backslash in `<Link>`
  and `useNavigate`, a constructor injection in SSR hydration, and an XSS in the
  RSC error handler. Only the open redirect is reachable in Tome - the SSR and
  RSC issues cover render modes Tome does not use, and the DoS is client-side in
  a static SPA, so it can only affect the tab it runs in. A fifth advisory
  (GHSA-qwww-vcr4-c8h2, CSRF bypass in RSC mode) has no 7.x fix at all and is
  equally unreachable from a `BrowserRouter` app; it is left for a future major
  upgrade rather than pulled into a patch release.
- Updated `postcss` to 8.5.25, clearing a path-traversal advisory in source-map
  auto-loading. Build-time only - postcss reaches Tome through Vite and is not
  part of a deployed instance.
- Updated `brace-expansion`, a dev-only transitive dependency, to clear a
  denial-of-service advisory.

### Build
- Release images now publish a major-version tag as well, so
  `ghcr.io/bndct-devops/tome:2` follows the newest 2.x release without pinning a
  minor or patch. The existing `:2.1`, `:2.1.1` and `:latest` tags are unchanged.
  Thanks to @bl1nk for the contribution. (#163)

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-26 - "Palimpsest"

### Added
- **KOSync clients now pick up your Tome reading position** (#156). The
  KOSync-compatible endpoint (stock KOReader sync, Readest, and friends)
  used to be an island: it only ever served what a KOSync client itself had
  pushed, so progress from the web reader never reached those apps. The sync
  pull now answers with the newer of the two - the last KOSync push or
  Tome's own position (web reader or TomeSync device) - at percentage
  precision, since KOSync locators and web CFIs aren't convertible. The
  bridge is strictly read-only: KOSync pushes still never move positions on
  devices running the TomeSync plugin.
- **KOSync documents auto-link by file hash.** Linking a synced document to
  its Tome book no longer depends on the OPDS-download heuristic: any file
  that came from Tome is recognised by its KOReader partial-MD5 and linked
  automatically on the first push or pull. The OPDS heuristic remains as a
  fallback for files Tome has never seen.
- **Manual sync linking in the UI.** When a KOSync client has synced a
  document that isn't attached to any book, the book page offers a small
  "Link KOReader sync" picker - no more calling the API by hand.
- **Imported KOReader history shows up as sessions - and single sittings can
  be deleted.** Reading synced from KOReader's statistics (including history
  from before Tome existed) used to count toward the totals but never appear
  in Recent Sessions or the per-book session list, so a book could claim "1
  session" over an empty list and an accidental open was impossible to remove
  without wiping the book's whole imported history. The session lists now
  include imported sittings (marked "imported", grouped the same way KOReader
  groups sessions), each deletable on its own; the book page's session count
  matches the sittings that count. Imported sittings can't be trimmed -
  KOReader's own idle-capping already applies. On books with imported
  history, the plugin's live device sessions describe the same reading a
  second time, so they are excluded from the totals - but they stay in the
  list with a "not counted" label rather than disappearing. An info popover
  next to the session lists explains all of this in place.
- **Click a day in the book page's Activity chart to manage that day's
  sessions.** Each bar opens a popup with the sittings that started on that
  day - trim or delete right there instead of scrolling the full session
  log to find the one stray entry.
- The Habits tab's session timeline now draws imported KOReader sittings
  too, so device reading on stats-synced books appears in the ribbon
  instead of leaving those days blank. The superseded live device sessions
  are left out of the drawing - the same reading would otherwise paint
  twice.
- **Clear imported history per book.** The Reading intensity panel on a book
  page grows a small trash action that removes the current user's imported
  KOReader page data for that book — the manual escape hatch for mixed cases
  the automatic repair deliberately leaves alone. Web and manual sessions are
  unaffected, and reading the book on a device again re-imports from there on.
- **Runaway reading sessions are over (KOReader plugin, build 37).** A device
  that never actually sleeps — a cover that fails to suspend it, or a reader
  who fell asleep mid-chapter — used to book the whole wall-clock span as
  reading, turning a 15-minute evening into an 8-hour session (#150). The
  plugin now counts active reading the way KOReader's own statistics do:
  each gap between page turns is credited at most an idle cap (10 minutes by
  default, configurable in TomeSync settings, including off), and the session
  ends at the last page turn rather than whenever the device finally slept.
- **Trim a session instead of deleting it.** Sessions that idled — real
  reading followed by hours of nothing — can now be shortened from the
  Recent Sessions list: a scissors button opens a small editor, pre-filled
  with a suggested duration computed from the session's page turns at your
  own median reading pace, so the reading stays and the idle tail goes.
  Suspicious sessions (implausibly long, or minutes per page turn) are
  marked with a warning icon and the list can sort longest-first. The same
  session list lives in two more places: the per-book time table on the
  Library stats tab expands per book, and every book page grows a
  collapsible "Sessions" section under Reading Stats — so sessions stay
  editable even on a stats dashboard with those tiles removed.
- **A heads-up when a runaway session syncs.** Sessions arriving from older
  plugin builds still get sanity-checked on the server: an implausibly long
  one raises a bell notification pointing at Reading Stats, so a bad night
  never silently distorts your numbers.

### Fixed
- A seconds-long accidental open synced from KOReader history now shows up
  in the session lists and the Activity day popup so it can be deleted.
  Such blips are below the noise floor for session counting (a 7-second
  page flip is not a sitting) and were filtered out of the lists entirely -
  but their seconds still drew an Activity bar and set "last read", so the
  one entry people most want to remove was the one entry that never
  appeared, and its day popup claimed "No sessions recorded".
- KOSync progress pushes now follow the same read-status rules as every
  other sync path: finishing requires 99% (was 95%), completion is sticky
  (a re-read no longer drags a finished book back to "reading"), and the
  finish date is recorded.
- Imported KOReader reading history can no longer land on the wrong volume of
  a series (#152). When a volume read on the device was missing from the Tome
  library, the history importer's title matching could confidently attribute
  its entire reading log to a sibling volume — hours of sessions and page
  data on a book never opened. The matcher now treats a parsed volume number
  as authoritative: a candidate claiming a different volume is never matched,
  half-volumes (2.5) resolve exactly instead of truncating, and French-style
  "T2" tome numbering is understood. History for a volume Tome doesn't own is
  parked until the book exists rather than guessed onto a lookalike.
- On update, previously mis-imported history heals itself: stored matches are
  re-verified against the fixed rules on startup, ghost page data whose book
  has no other import source is removed, the device re-syncs its history on
  the next connection, and a notification explains what happened. Books where
  wrong and genuine history are mixed are left untouched and flagged instead.

- Chart tooltips on Reading Stats no longer detach from the cursor or hide
  behind neighbouring tiles (#151). The activity heatmap, the hour-by-day
  heatmap, and the timeline ribbon all rendered their hover tooltip inside
  the dashboard tile, where the grid's CSS transform re-anchored it and
  clipped it under adjacent cards; tooltips now render at the document root
  and follow the mouse everywhere.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-19 - "Omnibus"

### Added
- **Share a shelf, a series, or a single book — metadata only, by design.**
  Shelves (share icon in the sidebar), series (share icon on the series
  page), and individual books (Share button on the book page) can each mint
  a revocable public link: a clean read-only page with covers, titles, tags,
  descriptions, your ratings and highlights — and your reading of it: time,
  reading days, finish dates, and a little day-by-day activity strip. It never exposes files — no
  downloads, no reading, no route to book content at all; links are
  unguessable, marked noindex, and die the moment you revoke them.
- **Reading Timeline — your reading life on one ribbon.** A new Timeline tab on
  Reading Stats draws every book you've ever read as a bar in time: one lane
  per series (named in a frozen rail on the left), volumes as numbered bars
  spanning first to last active day, and the intensity of each day's reading
  shaded inside the bar. Lifetime data, including imported KOReader history,
  reconciled the same way as the rest of stats. Zoom from a year-at-a-glance
  down to month detail, hover any bar for the cover and totals, click through
  to the book. The tab renders full-bleed — edge to edge, viewport-tall — and
  the ribbon is also available as a regular tile in the dashboard gallery.
- **Sync on suspend (KOReader plugin, build 35).** Two new opt-in settings
  make morning stats current without waking the device (#128). "Sync on
  suspend" catches up anything still pending — sessions, ratings, and the
  reading-history backfill — when the device goes to sleep, provided WiFi is
  already connected. "Aggressive sync" additionally turns WiFi on first for
  devices that sleep the radio (e.g. PocketBook), letting the system power it
  back down as the device suspends. Everything on this path is
  queue-or-resume safe: if the device sleeps before the sync finishes, it
  completes on the next connection. Reconnecting WiFi now also catches up the
  reading-history backfill (previously launch-only) and flushes pending
  sessions even before a book is opened.
- **Shelves on your device (KOReader plugin, build 36).** The TomeSync series
  browser gains a Shelves entry: your saved shelves listed with live counts,
  each drilling into the same book list as a series — download per book or
  all at once, read-status markers included. Shelf filters resolve
  server-side (search, series, author, tag, format, language, library,
  reading status, rating).
- **Sync closed books (KOReader plugin, build 34).** A new TomeSync menu
  action walks the device for books the plugin has never synced — read before
  Tome existed, sideloaded, or opened under another launcher — matches them
  against your library by content hash, and adopts each one's status, rating
  and reading position from its KOReader sidecar. Adoption only fills what
  Tome doesn't already have: it can never overwrite live sync state or your
  own curation. The sweep is resumable (interrupting it loses nothing) and
  cheap to re-run — books are skipped until their sidecar actually changes.
  Matched books also become fully synced from then on, positions, highlights
  and all.
- **Search your library from the device (KOReader plugin, build 33).** The
  series browser gains a "Search library…" entry: submit-based free-text search
  over title, author, and series, with your last searches one tap away. Results
  open the same drill-down list as a series — tap to download, hold to set read
  status.
- **Browse by author on the device (build 33).** A new author axis in the
  series browser — the natural way into standalone books, which previously all
  hid behind the single "No Series" bucket. Downloads file each book by its own
  series/author identity, exactly like the web.
- **Set read status from the device browser (build 33).** Hold any book row in
  a series, author, or search list to mark it unread / reading / read on the
  server — no need to open the book. The lists also show each book's current
  status alongside the existing "on device" marker.
- **Position pull strategy (KOReader plugin, build 32).** What happens on book
  open when the server position differs from the device is now configurable,
  like stock KOSync: "Server position is ahead" and "Server position is
  behind" each offer *Ask before jumping / Jump automatically / Do nothing*
  (TomeSync settings). Defaults keep the historic behavior — forward jumps
  happen silently, backward jumps never — and the ask-dialog is deferred a
  moment after open so it can never swallow a "on book opening" profile the
  way the old layout-reset bug did.
- **Position history — undo a bad sync.** Tome now keeps a short log of every
  meaningful reading-position change per book (device, web, manual — the
  idle heartbeat doesn't spam it). A history button on the book page's
  Reading Stats header lists them, and any entry can be restored as the live
  position with one click — including explicitly un-finishing a book that a
  device falsely jumped to 100%. Devices pick the restored position up on
  their next sync. The classic sync horror story is no longer unrecoverable.
- **Import your Goodreads or StoryGraph history.** Settings → Import reading
  history takes either service's CSV export, matches it against your library
  (ISBN first, then title/author), and shows a full preview before anything
  is written. Importing only fills gaps — statuses, ratings, reviews, and
  finish dates you already have are never overwritten — and "to read"
  shelves are skipped. Pre-Tome reading finally lands on the lifetime
  timeline.
- **Push notifications to ntfy, Gotify, or any webhook.** Settings →
  Notifications lets each user add outbound channels; every in-app
  notification (wish fulfilled, new volume detected, reading goals) is
  pushed the moment it happens instead of waiting for the next visit. Each
  channel has a test button, can be paused, and tokens are stored
  server-side only. `TOME_OUTBOUND_NOTIFY=false` switches the whole feature
  off; nothing is sent unless a user configures a channel.
- **"Time left in chapter" in the web reader.** The reader footer now shows
  "~12 min left" beside the chapter name, computed from the book's chapter
  map and your own measured reading pace (a sensible default until you have
  reading history). Quietly absent for books without a chapter map or word
  count.
- **Edit highlight notes from the web.** The Highlights page and the book
  page's Highlights & Notes section can now edit (or add) the note on any
  highlight — including ones made in KOReader — not just delete them. Edits
  win on your devices at their next sync, exactly like an edit made on
  another device.
- **Command palette.** Press Cmd+K (Ctrl+K) anywhere to jump straight to a
  book, series, author, or page — full-text book search with covers, ranked
  series/author matches, and quick navigation, all keyboard-driven. The
  header search box hints it, and it's listed under "?" shortcuts help.
- **Search previews everywhere.** On Stats, Highlights, Wishlist, and the
  other section pages, typing in the header search now shows a live dropdown
  of top matches (Enter still opens the full filtered grid) — previously
  those pages gave no feedback until Enter.
- **Upload knows what you already have.** Files added to the upload dialog are
  hashed in the browser and checked against the library before anything is
  sent — exact duplicates get an "already in your library" note with a link to
  the existing book and are skipped, instead of uploading megabytes just for
  the server to silently discard them.
- **Admin → Covers: cover-quality audit.** Lists books whose covers are
  missing, unreadable, or genuinely low-resolution (real thumbnails, not
  standard-source covers), with sizes shown. Books with no cover at all offer
  a one-click auto-fix from the cover search (nothing to downgrade); low-res
  ones deep-link to the book page to pick a better candidate by eye.
- **One-click instance backup and staged restore.** Admin → Server gains an
  Instance backup card: download a consistent snapshot of everything Tome
  knows (database + covers + manifest; book files stay on disk), and restore
  one by uploading it — the restore is validated, requires typing RESTORE,
  and applies at the next server restart so it never happens under a live
  database. The previous database is kept alongside as a safety copy.
- **"What's new" after an upgrade.** The first visit after the server moves to
  a new release shows a one-time panel with that release's notes, straight
  from the changelog — so features stop shipping invisibly. Dismiss it and it
  stays gone until the next release; fresh installs never see it.
- **Update indicator for admins.** Settings → About quietly shows "vX.Y.Z
  available" (linking to GitHub releases) when a newer release exists, via a
  daily-cached server-side check. Set `TOME_UPDATE_CHECK=false` to disable
  the lookup entirely — nothing else phones home.
- **Timeline: the tooltip now answers at day level.** Hovering a bar resolves
  the exact day under the cursor — "15 May · 22m", or "no reading" on a gap
  day — alongside the book's totals. The day data was always drawn as tick
  intensity; now it's readable.
- **Timeline on phones.** The series rail narrows so the ribbon keeps most of
  the screen, and bars are tap-friendly: the first tap shows the details
  tooltip, a second tap opens the book (tapping empty space or scrolling
  dismisses it). Previously any tap navigated away immediately.
- **Highlights page polish.** The deferred cluster from the original
  commonplace-book release: an **only-notes filter** (show just the highlights
  carrying your own notes — composes with search and on-this-day), a real
  **file export** (download all matching highlights as a Markdown file, next to
  the existing copy-to-clipboard), **keyboard shortcuts** (`/` search, `Esc`
  clear, `c` collapse all, `n` only-notes, `e` export — listed in the `?`
  help), and a **shuffle button** on the Home tab's highlight spotlight that
  re-rolls to a different quote.
- **Time per chapter.** Book pages now show where your reading time went
  chapter by chapter: the book's table of contents is extracted at ingest into
  device-independent chapter boundaries, and KOReader per-page reading data is
  mapped into them — robust to font/margin changes, since every page record is
  interpreted against its own pagination. Renders on the book detail page next
  to the reading-intensity curve whenever both a chapter map and synced page
  data exist. Existing libraries get chapter maps via the Admin → Word Counts
  backfill, which now also extracts chapters (and intrinsic page counts, below)
  in the same pass.
- **Intrinsic page counts for fixed-layout books.** PDFs and comic archives now
  store their real page count at ingest (EPUB deliberately doesn't — reflowable
  pagination is not a property of the book). Backfilled by the same admin job.

### Fixed
- **The audit log covers new features again.** A coverage pass wired audit
  entries into everything that had shipped without them: instance backup
  download and restore staging/cancel/apply, OPDS PIN and KOReader plugin
  key lifecycles, book type and series/arc curation, Hardcover account
  link/unlink, notification channels (never the token), reading-history
  imports, cover changes, bulk downloads, session deletes, highlight
  deletes, and position restores. Device sync telemetry and personal
  micro-writes stay deliberately unlogged.
- **Stats on phones: dead gap and misaligned range picker.** The Stats page
  header paid the notch inset a second time inside the app shell (the top bar
  already covers it), opening a large empty band between the top bar and the
  page title on the installed app; and when the timeframe picker wrapped below
  the title on narrow screens it stayed floated right, reading as misaligned.
  The header now sits flush and the picker takes a full, left-aligned row.
- **The mobile app no longer feels like a draggable website.** On phones the
  page content could be dragged sideways and rubber-banded (on iOS the Focus
  view's scaled cover fan still counted its full unscaled width as scrollable
  overflow), the viewport bounced past its edges, double-tap zoomed, and a
  long press selected interface text — classic browser-tab behavior. The app
  now clamps content to the viewport width, suppresses edge bounce and scroll
  chaining, removes double-tap zoom (taps fire immediately), disables text
  selection on interface chrome for touch devices (text fields and the reader
  keep it), and sizes the shell to the real visible viewport instead of
  overhanging behind mobile browser toolbars.
- **The notifications panel no longer renders behind sticky page content.** The
  top bar sat at the same layer as page-level sticky toolbars (and below the new
  timeline axis), so the open notification dropdown was cut by the Stats
  toolbar. The top bar now stacks above content-level sticky elements.
- **Chapter maps now extract from EPUB2 books.** Older EPUBs keep their table
  of contents in an NCX file rather than an EPUB3 nav document; chapter
  extraction ignored the NCX, so classics and older rips silently produced no
  Time-per-chapter data. Extraction now falls back to the NCX whenever the nav
  yields nothing — re-run Admin → Word Counts to pick up the affected books.
- **TOC-less EPUBs no longer re-queue in the Word Counts backfill forever.**
  Books whose files genuinely have no usable table of contents were re-parsed
  on every run because "done" was inferred from having chapter rows; a
  dedicated attempt marker now records "tried, nothing there" once.
- **A fast server clock can no longer silently swallow highlights (build 32).**
  Highlight edits and deletes made in the web reader are stamped with the
  server's clock; on a device whose clock runs behind (UTC container vs local
  device time), those stamps landed in the device's future and outranked every
  later local change — a re-highlight after a web delete just vanished until
  the clocks crossed. The plugin now stamps its wall-clock on every highlight
  sync and the server shifts the stamps it minted itself into that device's
  clock frame, both when comparing and in what it returns; the plugin
  additionally refuses to store any stamp from the future. Older plugins keep
  the previous behavior.
- **The TomeSync plugin no longer bloats KOReader's global settings file
  (build 32).** Its data tables (book map, pending sessions and ratings, sync
  baselines, repair aliases) — which grow with your library and were parsed by
  KOReader at every boot — moved into a dedicated `tomesync_state.lua`,
  migrated automatically and crash-safely on first launch. State for books no
  longer on the device is pruned; pending queues are never pruned.
- **The plugin's series list no longer runs one query per series.** Loading the
  series browser was an N+1 that scaled with the library; it's now a single
  query with the same response.
- **The Highlights "copy all as Markdown" export never worked.** It requested
  more highlights than the API's page cap allowed, got a 422, and failed
  without any feedback. The cap is raised, the export stays under it, and a
  failure now shows an error toast instead of silently doing nothing.
- **Bindery no longer invents a series from the filename.** Prose ebooks named
  `Title 5.epub` used to come out of review with their series set to their own
  title (the bare-number manga-chapter heuristic misfiring on novels); the
  real series name in `(Series Book N)` parentheticals — the common
  Amazon/Calibre naming — was stripped as noise; and the metadata embedded in
  the file itself (`calibre:series` etc.) was extracted but never reached the
  review form. All three are fixed: the filename parser now understands
  `(Series Book N)` / `(Series #N)` markers and the `NN. Title - Author (Year)`
  layout (filling the author field too), bare trailing numbers on EPUB/PDF no
  longer fabricate a series, and the review form pre-fills from embedded
  metadata with the same "file beats filename" precedence auto-import has
  always used.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-07-05 — "Spine"

### Added
- **Hardcover sync.** Link your personal Hardcover account in Settings and Tome
  pushes your ratings and reading progress to it — one-way, opt-in, and nothing
  is ever deleted on Hardcover. Ratings go out shortly after you change them;
  progress goes out in batches as print-edition pages (`round(pct × pages)`),
  and books whose edition has no page count sync status-only. Matching is
  ISBN-first with a strictly-guarded, volume-aware title+author search
  fallback that prefers the community's record over catalogue stubs. A
  dedicated **Hardcover page** (sidebar) shows every synced book with its
  cover and exact matched record, filterable by state, with per-book
  actions: pick the right record manually (search modal), re-match, or
  exclude. Matched books also link to their Hardcover record from the book
  page's Details grid. Tokens are stored encrypted, and when
  Hardcover's annual January-1 token reset hits you get a notification to
  re-link. Server kill switch: `TOME_HARDCOVER_SYNC_ENABLED` (the existing
  `TOME_HARDCOVER_TOKEN` stays metadata-only).
- **Half-star ratings.** Book and series ratings now take 4.5-style values —
  the star widgets select halves by clicking the left or right side of a star.
  Existing whole-star ratings are untouched. KOReader's native rating stays
  whole-star: the plugin (build 31) rounds a pulled half-star for the device
  without ever pushing the rounded value back over your half-star.
- **Page numbers on the book page.** Once a book is matched on Hardcover, the
  progress bar shows a font-size-agnostic "p. 142 of 384" from the print
  edition's page count alongside the percentage.

### Security
- **Quick Connect codes can no longer be brute-forced into a login.** Polling
  a code used to require nothing but the code itself — six characters, guessed
  fast enough, handed out a full login token once the code was authorized. The
  device that requests a code now also receives a long random poll secret, and
  only that pairing can collect the login; a guessed code gets the same "not
  found" as a nonexistent one. The short code is still all you type on the
  already-signed-in device — nothing changes in the flow you see.
- **A KOReader sync registration can no longer claim your account.** The KOSync
  registration endpoint (which KOReader's "Register" button calls without any
  authentication) used to attach the new sync credential to whatever Tome
  account had the same username — so anyone who knew a username could register
  it first and have their reading activity land on that account. Device-side
  registrations now start unlinked; connecting sync to your account is done
  signed-in via Settings → KOReader Sync, which also reclaims a squatted name
  by overwriting its key.

### Fixed
- **Reorganize is crash-safe and works across filesystems.** Library Health's
  one-click reorganise used to move every file first and write the database
  once at the end — a crash mid-batch left every already-moved file
  unfindable (and unhealable, since the repair tool starts from the stale
  database path). Each move is now committed individually, so an
  interruption loses nothing. Moves also switched to a copy-safe primitive,
  so a library spanning mounts (mergerfs, NFS, a series folder symlinked to
  another disk) no longer fails per-file. And when a file's canonical slot is
  already occupied by a different file, reorganise reports a conflict instead
  of silently renaming to "Title (2).epub" — a suffix the next health check
  would flag again, renaming it to (3), (4)… forever.
- **Deleting a book can no longer leave a permanent ghost row.** Files were
  removed from disk before the database delete committed; a crash in between
  kept the book in the library with nothing behind it — every download 404ed
  and no scan could heal it. The order is now inverted: the row goes first,
  and files are removed after (if that half is interrupted, the next scan
  simply re-imports the orphaned files).
- **"Purge empty folders" no longer eats Syncthing markers.** A folder whose
  contents were all hidden was treated as junk and emptied — which deleted
  `.stfolder` (halting the whole Syncthing share with "folder marker
  missing") and could delete versioned user files in `.stversions`. The purge
  now only removes recognised OS droppings (`.DS_Store`, `._*` AppleDouble
  files, `Thumbs.db`, `desktop.ini`); anything else — including any hidden
  directory, which previously crashed the endpoint mid-walk — means the
  folder is kept. The same whitelist governs the folder cleanup after a
  reorganise, which also no longer errors out after the moves have already
  succeeded.
- **A sideloaded book can no longer hijack another book's reading progress.**
  When KOReader opens a file Tome never served (a sideload, or a copy renamed
  on the device), Tome matches it to a library book by filename as a last
  resort. That matcher was too eager: a short title like *"It"* matched
  *The Italian Job*, a `Foo v2` filename landed on a standalone *"Foo"*, and a
  year in the name (`… - 1984 - …`) was misread as "volume 1984". Any of these
  silently wrote one book's position, sessions and highlights onto another.
  Matching is now strict — whole-word title matches, a minimum length before a
  substring counts, and a volume number in the filename must line up with the
  book's actual volume — and when it can't be sure it declines (the device just
  keeps tracking locally) rather than guessing. Books downloaded from Tome are
  unaffected: they match by content hash, not by name.
- **Reading position no longer flaps between two values.** The position table
  had no uniqueness guard, so a device sync and a web-reader save landing at
  the same moment could each create a row for the same book — after which reads
  picked an arbitrary one and the progress appeared to jump back and forth (and
  stats double-counted it). There is now one position per book, both writers
  update it in place, and a one-time cleanup collapses any existing duplicates
  to the most recent.
- **Marking a book "unread" on the web now sticks on your device too.** The
  reset cleared the web side but left the synced position untouched, so the
  next time the book opened on KOReader it jumped back to where you'd been and
  flipped itself to "reading" again. Marking a book unread now also clears the
  synced position.
- **Hardcover sync could pin a translation's or the audiobook's edition.**
  Publishers reuse one catalogue across translations and audio, so a stored
  ISBN sometimes names the German edition (or the audiobook) of the right
  book — your Hardcover profile then showed the German cover and title.
  Edition selection is now language-aware and audio-averse everywhere a match
  is made (ISBN, search, and manual pick): the book match is kept, but the
  pinned edition must agree with the book's language and prefers text
  editions with page data. Existing wrong matches repair via the Hardcover
  page's per-book "Re-match".

### Changed
- **Dark themes got a contrast pass.** Hairline borders were sitting at an
  alpha where most panels had none to speak of; they're a step stronger now
  across Dark, Ember and Black, secondary text is brighter, and the rosewood
  accent carries a little more color so buttons and progress bars don't read
  grey-brown. Light and Amber are untouched.
- **The Home dashboard has one primary surface now.** The quick-stats strip
  lost its box (the figures sit on the page), the right rail became a quiet
  tinted panel, and the content column is the single bordered, elevated card —
  before, all three wore identical chrome and nothing led the page.
- **Rating stars stepped back into the palette.** The gold is a notch quieter
  in every theme — a shelf of five-star rows was the loudest color on the page.
- **Top bar: quieter search, louder Upload.** The search box no longer wears a
  fill and a border at rest (it sharpens on focus instead), and Upload — the
  bar's one real action — is now a solid accent button rather than another
  neutral chip.
- **The sidebar recedes like the rail.** It takes the same quiet tint as the
  Home right rail, framing the content column instead of sharing its
  background, and empty libraries no longer show a ghost "0" count.
- **The Home Reading Log now reads like a log, not a ticker tape.** Back-to-back
  sessions of the same book collapse into one row ("3 sessions · 1h 08m"),
  entries group under day headers (Today / Yesterday / date), each row shows
  the session's clock time instead of repeating "yesterday" down the column,
  and rows link to the book.
- **Less badge noise on Home.** The format badge (EPUB/CBZ) no longer stamps
  every cover in Continue Reading / Recently Finished / Recently Added — on a
  one-format shelf it said nothing ten times over. Library grids keep it,
  since that's where formats actually differ.
- **Focus mode loads into a skeleton of itself** — a cover-and-text placeholder
  in the hero's real layout — instead of flashing a bare centered "Loading…"
  and teleporting the page in afterwards.
- **Reading DNA bars no longer masquerade as sliders.** The round thumb-on-track
  marker (which begged to be dragged) is gone; each trait now renders as a
  center-origin gauge filling toward the pole you lean to.
- **The top-bar sync chip identifies itself.** The anonymous colored dot next
  to "12h ago" is now a sync icon, tinted by how fresh the last KOReader sync
  is (green = minutes ago, amber = recent, grey = stale).
- **Grouped library counts say "titles" instead of "entries"** — with Group
  series on, "31 entries" read like a book count and never matched one; a
  series stack plus standalones are 31 titles.

### Added
- **The KOReader series browser got a quality pass** (plugin build 29). Big
  downloads show live progress (percent of file size) instead of sitting mute;
  a failed list-load or download offers **Retry** instead of a dead-end popup;
  a single fresh download asks **"Open now?"**; volumes you already have are
  marked **"on device"** in the list; and every request now has tight network
  timeouts, so a dead server stalls the reader for seconds, not a minute. The
  position heartbeat also moved off the page-turn path — it fires when the
  reader is idle, never while you're turning.
- **KOReader files are now recognised by content, not just by name.** Tome
  records the KOReader-style hash of every file it scans and every copy it
  serves, and the plugin (build 27) sends the open file's hash when it asks
  "which book is this?". A book you renamed or moved on the device — or
  sideloaded from the same source — now resolves exactly, with the careful
  filename matching kept as fallback. The reading-history import uses the same
  hashes first, so device history matches your library deterministically
  before any title guessing.
- **Session counts from imported device history are real sessions now.** The
  stats reconciliation used to approximate "one session per book per day";
  it now splits device reading at 30-minute gaps, the same way sessions are
  actually experienced. On a real multi-year device history that corrected a
  one-third undercount (320 → 470 sessions); reading time and page counts are
  unchanged, and a read across midnight counts once, on the day it began.
- **File books into libraries straight from the Bindery.** The review form
  (and the batch "apply to all" bar) now has a Libraries picker like the one
  on the book page, so an accepted book lands in the right libraries in one
  step instead of needing a second pass through each book (#103). There is
  also an "Add to libraries" picker right in the Bindery toolbar: set it once
  and the next Quick Accept or Review run files everything into those
  libraries (it resets afterwards, so the next batch starts clean). The book
  type's own library is still added automatically.
- **Batch review got real per-file metadata matching.** The suggestions panel
  used to silently search for the first file only; now clicking any file row
  targets the panel at it (the active row is highlighted), and a new
  "Match all" button fetches and applies the best match to every file in one
  go — trust the matcher, eyeball the rows, Accept All. The batch
  "Apply to all" buttons also confirm with a toast now instead of applying
  silently.
- **Create highlights in the web reader — they appear on your KOReader.** Select
  text while reading on the web, pick a colour, and optionally attach a note;
  the highlight paints immediately and syncs to your devices. Since the web
  reader and KOReader address text differently, a new highlight carries a
  provisional identity until your device next syncs the book: the plugin locates
  the passage natively and "adopts" it as a first-class KOReader highlight
  (build 25 / 1.7.0). You can also **edit notes and delete** any highlight from
  the tap-card — including ones made on the device — and the change wins on
  every device at its next sync. A passage the device can't locate stays
  web-only rather than landing on the wrong words.
- **Your KOReader highlights now show up inside the web reader.** Open a book on
  the web and the passages you highlighted on your device are painted right in
  the text, in their KOReader colours; tap one to see the full passage, its note
  and when you made it. Under the hood each highlight is re-anchored by its own
  text (device anchors don't translate to the web reader's engine), so a
  highlight whose passage can't be located — say it spans a page-break element —
  simply doesn't paint rather than pointing at the wrong words. Highlights load
  lazily per chapter, so big collections don't slow the reader down.
- **Follow a series — get told when a new volume is out.** A new opt-in release
  detector (set `TOME_RELEASE_DETECTION=true`; needs your Hardcover token) lets
  members follow a series: Tome polls Hardcover on a schedule (daily by default,
  `TOME_RELEASE_CHECK_INTERVAL`) and when the tracker's latest volume number
  grows past what it saw at follow time, you get a bell notification — and an
  email when SMTP is configured. Following starts silent: it primes at the
  series' current latest volume, so following a 27-volume series doesn't fire
  27 alerts. Follows live alongside your wishlist (`/api/wishlist/follow`,
  `/api/wishlist/follows`), and admins can trigger a check on demand.
- **Focus mode on the Home page.** A new minimalist Home view that surfaces the one
  book you're most likely to pick up next — your most-recently-synced in-progress
  title — as a large cover with the upcoming volumes of its series fanned behind it
  in a rotating "coverflow" display. Alongside it: the series, your progress and
  where you last synced from, a one-click **Resume reading**, and a quiet
  **Currently reading** strip to switch the spotlight to any other in-progress book.
  Clicking the cover or series name jumps to the series. Toggle between **Focus** and
  the full **Dashboard** from the Home header; your choice is remembered.
- **Your Reading DNA.** The Home dashboard shows a reading-personality card — an
  archetype (e.g. "Night-Owl Epic Specialist") distilled from a few traits like
  when you read, how long your sessions run, and how widely you range across the
  library. On Reading Stats it's also available as a **Reading DNA** tile — add it
  from **Add tile** under Habits; the Home card's "Full breakdown" link points there.
- **A richer reading log on every book.** A book's Reading Stats now show more of
  its story: a **progress line** traced over the activity bars so you can see how
  far you got on each reading day, a **momentum** indicator comparing the last week
  to the one before, a **"Where you read"** breakdown splitting your time across the
  web reader, KOReader and your devices, and a **Finished** date once you mark a
  book read. You can also **log a session by hand** — handy for paper reading or a
  device that wasn't synced — and **export** a book's reading log to CSV or JSON.
  Small "i" hints explain the progress and reading-intensity charts in plain language.

### Fixed
- **Sidebar Libraries/Shelves no longer flicker when switching pages.** Every
  page (Home, Stats, Highlights, Wishlist, Bindery) refetched the lists from
  scratch on navigation, blanking the sections for a beat. The lists are now
  cached across page mounts and refreshed silently in the background.
- **Re-downloading a book no longer deletes its synced highlights.** A fresh
  copy of a book starts with an empty annotation sidecar; the sync used to read
  that as "the user deleted every highlight" and pushed the deletions to the
  server (verified live — one re-download tombstoned the book's highlights
  everywhere). The sync now recognises a sidecar it hasn't seen before and
  re-applies the server's highlights instead. Deleting highlights on the device
  still propagates exactly as before.
- **Highlights from another device can no longer land on the wrong words.**
  Before painting a highlight that was made elsewhere, the plugin (build 28)
  now verifies the stored position actually reproduces the highlighted text on
  this copy of the book. When it doesn't (a re-downloaded copy can shift
  positions), the passage is found by its text and painted there — while the
  original device's position stays untouched on the server, so the two devices
  can't fight over it. Text that can't be located is skipped rather than
  guessed. Notes edited on a repaired highlight still sync everywhere.
- **Book matching no longer trusts a stale device checksum.** KOReader's
  sidecar hash can be inherited from a different copy of a book (metadata
  restores); the plugin now hashes the actual file when identifying it,
  which the emulator tests caught producing wrong lookups.
- **The KOReader reading-history import no longer risks out-of-memory on big
  histories.** The plugin used to load every page-stat row since the last sync
  into memory at once — tens of thousands of rows on a device with years of
  reading — and resend the full book list with every upload chunk. It now reads
  and uploads in small windows (verified against a real 34,000-row device
  database), sends each chunk only the books it references, and an interrupted
  run still resumes exactly where it left off. Plugin build 26; update from
  TomeSync's "Check for updates" as usual.
- **Annotations from another device can no longer break a book opened as a PDF
  or comic.** The cross-device highlight merge only knew how to rebuild
  annotations in the EPUB engine's format; on a PDF/CBZ it would still plant
  incoming ones as broken highlights — positions stored as text where the
  renderer expects page numbers and rectangles. The plugin (build 26) now
  reconstructs an annotation only when the receiving book can actually draw it;
  everything else stays safely in Tome instead of corrupting the book's
  annotation list.
- **The series-page action buttons line up again when you follow a series.** The
  "Next: Vol N" caption under the Following button used to push the button out of
  line with Resume / Mark all read / Manage; it now hangs below without shifting
  anything.
- **Metadata fetching got a deep overhaul.** The same book returned by two
  sources used to eat two of the five result slots — each copy *partial*
  (Hardcover knows series but not language; Google the reverse). Duplicates are
  now merged across sources into one complete candidate, results are ranked by
  the same relevance score everywhere (the right volume of a series now beats
  the wrong volume from a "better" source), and every path — the fetch dialog,
  bulk review, bulk apply, Bindery, auto-import — agrees on what the best match
  is. Rate limits are handled honestly: sources are retried once with a pause,
  and when one is still throttled the dialog says so instead of pretending the
  book doesn't exist. Three more sharp edges filed down: auto-import no longer
  renames a book on a low-confidence match (it fills blanks instead), applying
  fetched metadata no longer wipes your hand-added tags, and bulk fetching
  paces itself instead of firing a hundred parallel searches that tripped the
  very rate limits above. A cross-check against realistic library shapes (manga
  volumes, light novels with series-only titles, wrong-edition ISBNs, foreign
  editions) caught four more: Hardcover's **series and publisher were never
  actually filled in production** (an id-type mismatch made that lookup a
  silent no-op since it shipped — fixed), foreign-language editions no longer
  merge into (and poison) the English candidate, light novels no longer match
  the manga adaptation of the same series (search is edition-aware now), and a
  stored ISBN that points at the wrong edition — damage the old auto-apply
  itself caused — no longer monopolises the results. Edition awareness also
  understands custom book types now ("Webtoons", "graphic_novel", …), not just
  the seeded four.
- **AniList as a manga metadata source.** The existing sources are prose-first
  and often know nothing about a manga volume beyond its title. Books with a
  sequential-art type (manga, comics, webtoons, custom equivalents) now also
  query AniList (no API key needed): it appears as its own candidate with the
  series blurb, genres, staff and cover, and its series-level description,
  author and genres back-fill volume-level hits from the other sources that
  are missing them.
- **Scribe: `/scribe audit editions`.** A new audit check finds books whose
  stored ISBN belongs to the wrong edition of their series (a light novel
  carrying the manga's ISBN — damage older auto-apply versions could cause,
  which then poisons every later fetch) and proposes the correct edition's
  ISBN, publisher, year and description for approval.
- **Repeat searches are served from a short-lived cache.** Identical source
  queries within 15 minutes (re-opening the fetch dialog, bulk-fetching a
  series whose volumes share a series-level lookup) no longer re-hit the
  external APIs — less rate-limiting, faster results. Concurrent duplicates
  (a bulk fetch firing the same lookup for every volume at once) share a
  single outbound request instead of racing past each other.
- **No more flicker of the Follow UI on instances without release detection.**
  The Follow button, Following section and Upcoming-releases card rendered
  optimistically and hid after the server said the feature is off — a visible
  flash on every page view. They now stay hidden until the check resolves, and
  a disabled verdict is remembered for the session.
- **Bindery is back in the mobile menu.** The mobile drawer never got a
  Bindery link when the desktop sidebar did, so on a phone admins could only
  reach it by typing the URL (#101). It now sits under Wishlist with the
  pending-file count.
- **The mobile drawer got a tidy-up.** The five theme choices no longer stack
  as full-height rows — they are one compact "Theme" row of icon buttons — so
  the account section fits without pushing the navigation off screen.
- **Deleting a highlight from the web now sticks, even for a highlight you just
  made.** The deletion marker was stamped with the server's clock, but compared
  against the device's local wall-clock — so with a UTC server and a device in a
  later timezone, deleting a recent highlight produced a marker that looked *older*
  than the highlight itself, and the device quietly kept (and could re-upload) it.
  The marker is now stamped no earlier than the highlight's own timestamp, so the
  deleted copy always loses the tie while a deliberate re-highlight still wins.
  Also, the "N from M books" counter on the Highlights page no longer under-counts
  books after deleting when more highlights are still unloaded.
- **Hand-logged and web-reader sessions no longer vanish on device-synced books.**
  On a book with imported KOReader history, the "history wins" rule replaced *all*
  other reading records — so logging 30 minutes of paper reading appeared to do
  nothing, and web-reader time was invisible. The rule is now per source: the
  imported history replaces only the device's own live sessions (the same reading,
  recorded twice), while web-reader and manual sessions add on top — everywhere,
  from the book page's reading log down to the dashboard totals and streak days.
  A pleasant side effect: **"Where you read"** now actually shows the web/device
  split for mixed readers, and the progress line can draw through web-reading days
  on a device-synced book. Manual logging also got sturdier: a failed log now
  shows an error instead of silently resetting, absurd inputs (negative pages, a
  duration over 24h) are rejected instead of crashing, and a timezone-annotated
  start time is converted to UTC instead of having its offset ignored. The
  Activity chart also earned a real time axis: days without reading now appear
  as gaps instead of active days being stretched edge-to-edge (two adjacent
  bars could silently be a month apart), the "Where you read" bar separates its
  segments with a hairline seam, and the admin "All readers" line stays hidden
  when the only reader it would describe is you.
- **The "Finished" date is now the date you finished.** It used to be the last
  time anything touched the status row — rating a book in March that you finished
  in January showed "Finished: Mar", and even a device sync could nudge it. The
  finish date is now recorded explicitly at the moment a book becomes "read"
  (existing read books keep their best-known date), survives later ratings,
  reviews and position syncs, and clears if you un-finish the book. Also fixed on
  the way: a book synced straight from unread to 100% in one sitting now lands on
  "read" immediately (it used to sit at "reading" until the next sync), the
  admin-only "All readers" line counts consistent units (reading days) instead of
  mixing sessions with days, a book whose progress was known but had only one
  progress point showed that progress nowhere, and the chart "i" hints now close
  on outside tap on iPhones.
- **A font change no longer scrambles a book's page stats.** KOReader re-paginates
  when the font or margins change, and Tome sometimes mixed page numbers from
  different paginations: a book finished at 250 pages then reopened once at a
  1571-page pagination could show **"250 of 1571 pages · 16%"** despite being
  fully read, the Completion Estimates tile could report a nearly-finished book
  as barely started, and the **Re-reads** tile counted "page 10" under two
  different paginations as a revisit of the same page. Page coverage and reading
  position are now computed in fraction-of-book space (per row, against that
  row's own page count) and expressed against the *latest* pagination. Two more
  estimate fixes ride along: pages-per-day no longer drops the first active day
  from the denominator (which doubled a two-day reader's pace and halved the
  estimate), and the confidence label now comes from the signal that actually
  drove the estimate instead of whichever source happened to have more data.
- **Late-night reading no longer splits across two days — anywhere.** Tome has
  always counted a session started at, say, 1:30 am toward the previous evening's
  reading day for **streaks** (a local day with a 4-hour rollover), but newer
  features quietly bucketed by plain calendar days instead. The consequences: the
  activity heatmap could show a gap on a day the streak counted (the long-standing
  heatmap/streak drift), a continuous evening read crossing midnight could mark a
  book as a **re-read** and double its **reading-log** day count, the per-book
  **momentum** ("last 7 days vs prior") could disagree with the dashboard, and the
  Reading DNA **rhythm** trait split night reads into two active days. Every
  day-based view — daily chart, heatmap, re-reads, completion estimates, per-book
  timelines, reading intensity, momentum, Reading DNA — now shares the streak's
  single reading-day rule. The one deliberate exception is the hour-of-weekday
  heatmap, where 1 am should still display as 1 am.
- **Focus mode rough edges, rounded off.** A book without a cover showed the
  browser's broken-image glyph in the hero, the fan and the Currently-reading
  strip — it now gets the same tidy placeholder as everywhere else. Rapidly
  switching between strip books could leave the hero stuck on the wrong book (a
  slower earlier response landing last); switches are now cancelled cleanly. With
  more than 12 books in progress the extras were silently unreachable — the strip
  now ends in a **"+N more"** chip into the filtered library. Sync times read
  naturally ("1 hour ago", and past a month the actual date instead of "412 days
  ago"), the empty state gained a **Browse library** button, Series Progress rows
  no longer reload the whole app, and a brand-new user no longer sees an empty
  bordered box beside the dashboard. The Reading DNA figures are also no longer
  computed for views that never show them (and on phones, only fetched when the
  Home dashboard actually renders). Two touch-ups from a polish pass: the small
  kicker line no longer repeats the series name that the big title right below
  it already shows, and on phones the hero stacks from the top instead of
  floating mid-screen with dead space above the covers. The Reading DNA trait
  markers also stay inside their bars at the extremes instead of half-clipping.
- **Sharper axis labels and richer tooltips on stats charts** *(shipped in v1.7.x
  polish, previously missing from this log)*: KPI tile labels no longer truncate
  mid-word, and the daily chart's tooltips include pages alongside minutes.
- **The top bar on Stats, Highlights, Wishlist and the Bindery is now the real
  one.** It was a near-copy of the dashboard's header that had already drifted:
  on phones its Upload button was an empty pill (the icon had been lost in the
  copy), uploading from those pages silently dropped the "this upload satisfies
  N wishes" notice — and on the Bindery didn't refresh the inbox — and the
  search box neither advertised nor honoured the **/** focus shortcut the
  dashboard has. There is now a single shared header component used everywhere,
  so the two can't drift apart again; the wish notice, Bindery refresh and
  **/** shortcut all work from every page.
- **Standalone books download to the correct book-type folder in KOReader.** A book
  with no series — say a RoyalRoad title — could be filed under the wrong type's
  folder (e.g. `light_novel`) when downloaded through the plugin, while books in a
  series went to the right place. The plugin filed an entire batch under a single
  type, which is fine for a real series but wrong for the "No Series" bucket, where
  standalone books of different types are mixed together. Each book now carries its
  own type and is filed accordingly, in both the built-in layout and custom download
  templates. Requires plugin build 24 (1.6.2), delivered via the usual in-app update.
- **A tidier Home header on phones.** On narrow screens the stats strip now spans
  the full width with the figures spaced apart instead of crowding together, and the
  **Focus / Dashboard** switch sits below it as a full-width toggle rather than
  floating in a half-empty row. The desktop layout is unchanged.
- **Reading progress for device-read books is no longer understated.** A book you
  were, say, 35% through could show as 11% — both in its **progress** figure and in
  the **Completion Estimates** tile (which then wildly overestimated the time left).
  The cause: progress was derived from how many distinct pages your KOReader history
  had logged time on (coverage), not how far through you actually are (position).
  Progress now uses your real reading position, falling back to the furthest page
  reached, so it matches what your reader shows — and finished books read 100%.
- **Per-book "all readers" totals now include device reading.** On a book read
  only through the KOReader plugin (imported page-stats, no live sessions), the
  admin "All readers" line showed 0m / 0 sessions / 0 readers; it now reflects that
  reading.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-06-28 — "Signature"

### Added
- **Per-page reading stats from your KOReader history.** Once you've imported your
  device's reading history, each book page gains a **Reading intensity** strip —
  where your time actually went across the book, page by page — plus an honest
  **"X of Y pages"** read (from the real page count, not a guess) and a note when
  you've re-read stretches. A book's reading stats (time, pages, dates, pace) now
  also reflect that imported history, so books you only ever read on the device
  are no longer shown as blank. On the dashboard, a new **Re-reads** tile (from the
  tile gallery) ranks the books whose pages you keep coming back to, and the
  **Completion Estimates** tile now measures progress by real pages turned — so it
  works for device reading too, not just the web reader.
- **The sidebar now follows you onto every page.** Stats, Highlights, Wishlist and
  the Bindery used to drop you onto a bare screen with only a back-arrow — to get
  from your stats to your highlights you had to bounce back through Home first.
  They now carry the same sidebar as the rest of Tome (your libraries and shelves,
  the full nav, your profile), so you can jump straight between any section and the
  whole app feels like one place instead of a handful of detached screens. The
  active section highlights itself, and on phones it's the same slide-in drawer.
- **A Highlights page — your commonplace book.** Every highlight and note you make
  in KOReader already syncs into Tome; now there's one place to read them all. The
  new **Highlights** page (in the sidebar) gathers your highlights across the whole
  library, grouped by book, each as a quote card with its chapter and note. Search
  filters across everything at once — text, notes, chapter, and book title — with
  the matches marked; collapse books to scan a big collection, or fold them all at
  once. **On this day** resurfaces the highlights you made on today's date in past
  years, and the Home tab shows a single "on this day" highlight as a quote card
  (falling back to a random one). Each card shows when it was highlighted, with the
  full detail (time, chapter, colour, when it synced) on hover. **Export** copies
  your highlights as Markdown — per book or the whole set. This is the library-wide
  view of the same data you already see per book on each book's page. KOReader still
  owns your highlights, but you can now **delete** one from the web — handy for an
  accidental highlight you'd otherwise have to reopen the book to clear. Deleting
  here removes it everywhere: Tome records the deletion and your KOReader devices
  drop it on their next sync (a hover trash button with a quick confirm, on both the
  Highlights page and each book's Highlights & Notes panel).
- **Word counts for your books.** Tome now parses each EPUB's text to record its
  word count, shown in the **Details** panel on the book page. New uploads are
  counted automatically as they're added; CJK titles (Chinese / Japanese / Korean)
  are counted per character so they aren't undercounted. PDFs and comics don't have
  a word count. This is the groundwork for upcoming reading-speed and words-read
  stats. To fill in books added before this release, admins get a **Word Counts**
  tab under Admin with a one-click background backfill (it only reads your files —
  nothing on disk is changed — and shows live progress you can stop and resume).
- **Three reading-speed & length tiles on Reading Stats.** Now that Tome counts
  the words in your books, three new tiles turn that into insight: **Words Read**
  (your lifetime word count, broken out by year once you've finished books across
  more than one), **Reading Speed** (your true words-per-minute — words divided by
  the time KOReader actually recorded — with your fastest and slowest books, side
  by side on a wide tile), and **Book Length** (how long the books you finish tend
  to be, as a distribution with your average, median and longest). They're not on
  any board by default — add the ones you want from **Add tile** under Overview /
  Habits / Library.
- **A "Taste" tab on Reading Stats.** A fourth board next to Overview / Habits /
  Library, built from your book ratings: a **rating distribution** (how you spread
  your stars), **taste by genre** (your average rating per book type), your
  **highest & lowest rated** books, a **rating-vs-time** scatter (do you linger on
  the ones you rate higher?), **best-rated series**, and a **rating trend** over
  time. Like every other tile, each is add/move/resize/removable, and these ignore
  the date-range picker since ratings are all-time. Existing customised dashboards
  get the new tab appended without touching your current boards.
- **Five new Reading Stats tiles, available from the tile gallery.**
  **Lifetime Totals** (all-time hours / pages / books / streak), **Personal
  Records** (longest session, biggest reading day, most pages in a day),
  **Library Completion** (how much of what you own you've read, overall and per
  type), a **Reading Clock** (a 24-hour radial of when you read), and **Reading by
  Language**. They're not on any board by default — add the ones you want to any
  tab from **Add tile**.
- **Your stats now include reading from before TomeSync.** KOReader keeps its own
  per-page reading log (`statistics.sqlite3`) going back to whenever you started
  reading — often long before Tome existed. TomeSync can now import that history,
  backfilling your reading-time charts, streaks, heat-map, top books and pace with
  everything you read on the device. The first sync pushes your whole history
  (chunked and resumable, so it survives the device sleeping or dropping Wi-Fi);
  later syncs send only new reading. Turn it on in **TomeSync → Auto-sync reading
  history on launch**, or run it once from **TomeSync → Sync reading history**
  (also assignable to a gesture). It imports **reading time and pages only** — it
  never changes your read/unread status; that stays yours to set. Books are matched
  to your library automatically; anything it can't confidently match is left out
  rather than guessed. Requires TomeSync plugin build 22. (KOReader plugin semver
  1.6.0.)
- **Ratings set offline now sync.** A rating or review you set on KOReader while
  offline (or any time the server can't be reached) is now remembered and pushed
  to Tome the next time the device is online — on resume, on **Sync now**, or
  when you next close a book. Previously the rating was only sent when you opened
  or closed *that* book, so rating a book and never opening it again — the normal
  case for one you've just finished — could leave the rating stranded on the
  device. It now rides a small pending queue (like reading sessions do) that
  survives reboots. Requires TomeSync plugin build 21. (KOReader plugin semver
  1.5.1.)

### Changed
- **Send to KOReader is now on by default.** Queue a book from the web straight to
  your e-reader's TomeSync inbox — no email, no Amazon. It shipped as an off-by-
  default beta; now that it's had real-hardware time it's on out of the box
  (`TOME_SEND_TO_KOREADER`, still settable to `false` to disable).

### Fixed
- **KOReader no longer syncs one book's reading progress onto another.** When the
  plugin had to match a book by filename (e.g. after a file was moved or "Re-resolve
  all books" was used), a series whose name matched its first book's title — combined
  with a flat `{series} - 02 - {title}` download-naming template — could resolve every
  volume back to volume 1, so later volumes overwrote volume 1's position. The matcher
  now reads the volume number from all the filename shapes Tome produces, treats it as
  authoritative, and refuses to resolve (rather than guess wrong) when a filename is
  genuinely ambiguous.
- **TomeSync no longer gets stuck "offline" after your Kindle wakes up.** When the
  device slept and Wi-Fi dropped, three failed sync attempts in a row used to latch
  TomeSync into a permanent back-off — it then skipped every request and never
  recovered until KOReader was fully restarted, even once the network was back.
  Back-off is now time-based: it goes quiet for a minute, then quietly retries, and
  also clears the moment Wi-Fi reconnects, so reading sessions and positions resume
  syncing on their own. (Requires updating the KOReader plugin to build 23 via
  **TomeSync → Check for updates**.)
- **The Day-streak on the Home tab now matches your stats page.** After importing
  your KOReader reading history, the Home summary kept showing a shorter streak
  than the Stats page because it only counted live TomeSync sessions and ignored
  the imported page-stat days. Both now count reconciled reading, so a single,
  consistent streak shows everywhere.
- **A Home link in the book-page breadcrumb.** The breadcrumb root let you jump to
  the library but not back to the Home tab — and on a phone the lone house icon
  confusingly went to the library. It's now a proper root: **Home** then
  **Library**, both reachable (icon-only on mobile so neither is lost).

## [1.6.0] — 2026-06-21 — "Marginalia"

### Added
- **Filter your library by language.** The dashboard filter bar now has a
  **Language** dropdown alongside Series / Author / Tag / Format. It appears
  whenever your catalogue holds more than one language. Books carry messy
  language values from their embedded metadata (`en`, `eng`, `en-US`,
  `English` all mean the same thing) — Tome folds these to a single tidy entry
  ("English") so the dropdown stays clean. Because a Shelf just saves the active
  filters, you can save a per-language Shelf (e.g. one Shelf per language) and it
  populates itself — no manually adding books.
- **Your book ratings now sync with KOReader (both ways).** KOReader has its own
  native 1–5 star rating and review on the Book status screen — TomeSync now keeps
  it in step with Tome. Rate a book on the web and the next time you open it on the
  device (if it came over via TomeSync) the stars and review are written into the
  book, and rate it on KOReader and it flows back up to Tome when you close or
  suspend. A saved per-book baseline means only the side that actually changed is
  pushed; if both changed since the last sync, the web rating wins (Tome stays the
  single source of truth). Reading status (reading / finished) is untouched — that
  already syncs separately. Requires TomeSync plugin build 20. (KOReader plugin
  semver 1.5.0.)
- **Rate and review your books — and whole series.** Each book's detail page now
  has a 1–5 star rating and an optional review (auto-saved; collapses to a tidy
  quote with an edit affordance rather than an always-open box). Ratings are
  per-user and private to you. Your stars show on book cards across the library,
  and you can **sort by "My Rating"** and **filter** the grid (`Rated`, `3+`,
  `4+`, `5`). You can also rate a **series** as a whole from its page: a series
  rating is inherited by every volume you haven't rated individually (your own
  volume rating always wins), and a series' shown rating is your explicit rating
  if set, otherwise the average of your volume ratings — surfaced on series cards
  too. Stars use a theme-aware "rating gold" that fits each theme's palette. The
  "No Series" group can't be rated.
- **"Auto-fit height" toggle for list tiles on the Reading Stats dashboard.** Tiles
  like *Currently Reading* and *Reading Goals* can now size themselves to their
  content instead of a fixed height. Open a tile's config (gear icon in edit mode)
  and tick **Auto-fit height**: the tile then grows and shrinks to fit exactly how
  many items it holds — no half-empty box when you have one book in progress, and
  no need to resize by hand when you have a dozen. It's off by default, so existing
  tiles keep their manual size (and scroll); when on, the height handle is hidden
  (only width stays adjustable) and the tile carries a small "Auto" tag in edit
  mode, where it also previews its fitted height as you arrange the board. The book
  rows in *Currently Reading* are more compact, and the tile now shows a
  "No books in progress" placeholder instead of rendering blank when empty.
- **PDF books are now readable in the web reader.** Opening a PDF previously
  landed on "No readable file found" — the book detail page offered a **Read**
  button, but the reader only knew how to render EPUB and comics. PDFs now open
  in a proper in-browser reader (continuous scroll, rendered with pdf.js) that
  matches the rest of the app: light / sepia / dark page tint, fit-to-width or
  fit-to-height, zoom, keyboard navigation, and reading-progress tracking that
  syncs your position like the EPUB and comic readers. Large PDFs stay smooth —
  only the pages near the viewport are rendered, the rest are torn down to keep
  memory in check. (Being fixed-layout, PDFs don't reflow, so there's no
  font-size/font-family control as there is for EPUB.) (#61)
- **Shelved reading status.** A fourth reading state, set apart from
  Unread / Reading / Read, for books you've set aside without finishing.
  Shelving a book pulls it off Continue Reading, Series Progress, and the
  completion stats, but keeps your exact position (progress + CFI) so you can
  resume where you left off later — the middle ground between a stalled book
  cluttering your "reading" list and marking it Unread (which clears progress).
  A new **Shelved** library filter lists them, and reading the book again on
  any device moves it back to Reading automatically.
- **Undo on reading-status changes.** Changing a book's reading status now
  shows a toast with an **Undo** button (and lingers a little longer than a
  normal toast). Undo restores the full prior state — status, progress, and
  reading position — so an accidental tap on **Unread**, which clears your
  progress, is no longer a one-way trip.

### Fixed
- **Stats headline tiles no longer clip their numbers.** The small metric tiles
  on the Reading Stats dashboard (Reading Time, Sessions, Streak, …) now keep
  their value on a single line and on a shared baseline, so a long figure like a
  multi-hundred-hour reading time no longer wraps and gets cut off at the top,
  and the smaller "Longest: …" / "x of y started" captions no longer clip at the
  bottom. The "Completion Rate" and "Books Finished" tile titles were shortened
  to "Completion" and "Finished" so their headers fit without truncating.

## [1.5.1] — 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- **Private libraries now actually hide books.** Book visibility is gated solely
  by library membership: a book placed in a private library is hidden from
  everyone except the library's owner, its assigned users, and admins —
  regardless of who uploaded it. Previously every book uploaded by an admin was
  shown to all members and guests no matter which library it was in, so an admin
  who filed books into a private library still leaked their contents. Books that
  aren't in any library remain visible to everyone (a member's own unfiled
  uploads stay private to them); to restrict a book, place it in a private
  library. The rule is now applied consistently everywhere books surface — the
  library grid, the series and filter (facet) lists, single-book and series
  pages, OPDS, and the TomeSync (KOReader) series browser, which previously
  applied no visibility filter at all and exposed the entire catalogue. (#53)
- **Custom themes now apply to the stats charts.** The reading-stats widgets
  (activity heatmaps, progress rings, bars) and the card hover-glow read
  dedicated `--chart-accent` / `--accent-soft` CSS variables that a custom
  theme never set, so they kept rendering in the built-in coral accent no
  matter which palette you picked. Custom themes now derive both from the
  palette's primary colour, like the built-in themes do. (#55)

## [1.5.0] — 2026-06-13 — "Rubric"

### Added
- **Reading goals.** Set yourself a target — books per year or month, minutes
  or pages per day or week — and watch a progress ring fill as you read. Goals
  live on the stats dashboard in a new **Reading Goals** tile — one card per
  goal, all managed in place (add, edit and delete each goal right on its
  card; preset chips like the classic 12/24/52-books year challenge get you
  started) — and compact read-only rings appear on the Home tab. A goal can
  be scoped to a single book type, so "20 books this year" and "20 manga this
  year" count separately — no padding the year challenge with
  one-sitting volumes. Progress is computed from reading you already track
  (sessions from KOReader and the web reader, finished books), year and month
  goals show whether you're ahead of or behind pace, and reaching one drops a
  notification in the bell. Goals are per-user; nothing is shared.
- **Group by series in the library view.** A new toggle in the All Books
  toolbar collapses each series into a single stacked card — first volume's
  cover, a volume-count badge, and a subtle stacked-paper look — so one long
  manga run no longer drowns out the rest of the grid. Standalone books render
  as normal cards. Clicking a stack opens the series detail view (status badge,
  arcs, Continue Reading and all); clicking the series name on an individual
  book card still filters the grid as before. Active filters apply inside the
  stacks: if a filter matches only 2 of 15 volumes the badge shows 2, and
  series with no matching volumes disappear. The toggle is off by default and
  remembered per device. (#43)
- **KOReader plugin: opt-in WiFi auto-connect.** Some devices (notably
  PocketBook) sleep WiFi so aggressively that every TomeSync action just failed
  with "offline". A new **Settings → Auto-connect WiFi when needed** toggle
  lets KOReader re-establish the connection first (honouring your KOReader
  network prompt/auto setting) and then runs the action — browsing series,
  downloads, Sync now, Test connection, update checks, and the Inbox. Off by
  default: with the toggle off the plugin behaves exactly as before. Only
  user-initiated actions reconnect; background tracking never wakes the radio.
  (build 18 / 1.3.0, #38)
- **KOReader plugin: choose where downloads go.** A new **Settings → Download
  location & naming** option controls how the plugin files series downloads,
  inbox deliveries — everything. Three choices: the default layout
  (book-type/series folders, standalones under their author), **Flat in home
  folder** (every book lands directly in the home folder as
  "Series - NN - Title", so nothing nests), or a **custom template** built
  from tokens — `{book_type}` `{series}` `{volume}` `{volume:00}` `{title}`
  `{author}`, with `{Lower(...)}`/`{Upper(...)}` case modifiers and `/`
  starting a new folder, Sonarr-style. Empty tokens drop out cleanly (one
  template serves series books and standalones), every path segment is
  sanitized so a template can never escape the library folder, and templates
  are validated when saved with a preview of the resulting filename. The
  setting is per-device and stored in KOReader. Already-downloaded books are
  remembered by ID, so changing layout doesn't re-download your library.
  (build 19 / 1.4.0)

### Changed
- **Pick your own cover size.** The library's three fixed views (large grid,
  small grid, list) become two — grid and list — with a slider next to the
  view toggle that sets the cover size anywhere between dense and poster-sized.
  Columns flow to fit, card text scales with the size, and your old
  large/small preference migrates to the matching slider position. Layout
  changes animate: covers glide into their new positions when the grid
  reflows — including when you change filters or sorting — and the grid/list
  switch fades instead of hard-cutting.
- **A new look: oxblood, paper, and a proper display face.** Tome's violet
  accent is gone — the new identity is a deep bookbinding-leather red (oxblood
  in the light themes, a dusty rosewood in the dark ones) on warm paper
  neutrals, with headings set in Bricolage Grotesque. Smaller refinements ride
  along: the book-detail reading stats collapse from a wall of bordered
  mini-tiles into one quiet panel, section headers drop the ALL-CAPS treatment
  (the stats dashboard's tile titles and table headers included, so long labels
  like "Completion Rate" no longer clip — and dashboard tiles sit flat instead
  of floating on a shadow outside of edit mode),
  cover hover-tilt is subtler, the grid no longer re-runs its entrance
  animation on every filter change, and grid cards lose the repetitive
  book-type pill (list view keeps it). The series page's reading stats get the
  same flattened one-panel treatment as the book detail page, the Settings
  section headers move to the display face, the admin audit-log and sync badges
  trade the last of the violet for the new accent, and the book-detail delete
  confirmation no longer makes the toolbar buttons shift by a border's width.
- **One green, one blue, one amber.** Success, info, and warning colors across
  the app (audit-log badges, settings notices, upload states, toasts, sync
  dots, library-health panels and more) now come from three theme-aware tokens
  tuned to the new identity — dusty and low-chroma like the rosewood accent —
  instead of ~80 hardcoded Tailwind greens, blues, and ambers that each picked
  their own shade. The stats dashboard joins in: the Reading Pace charts trade
  their hardcoded green for the chart accent, and trend indicators and the
  100%-complete series bar use the semantic tokens. Book-type and file-format
  color labels keep their palette.
- The Wishlist page no longer repeats its own title above the list: the
  in-page section header now reads "Open (N)" (pairing with "Fulfilled"), and
  on an empty wishlist it disappears entirely — the empty state moves up and
  carries the "Learn more" link inline. The Fulfilled section also starts
  expanded instead of hiding its cards behind a collapsed row.
- **A calmer Home tab.** The four boxed stat chips become one quiet
  hairline-divided panel (icons intact, and a zero-day streak no longer leads
  the page), Continue Reading is ordered by when you last read instead of when
  the book was added, and reading-progress strips on grid covers get a minimum
  width so a just-started book shows a visible nub. The sidebar's collapse
  toggle moves from its own orphaned row down to the user footer, the Shelves
  section header only appears once you have shelves, and empty-library counts
  render muted.
- **Five themes, structured.** The theme lineup is now a neutral pair
  (Light/Dark), a warm pair (Amber and the new **Ember**, a cappuccino dark),
  and a new true-black **Black** theme for OLED screens. The pickers in
  Settings, the sidebar menu, and the login screen group them accordingly.
- **KOReader plugin: clearer menu.** The ambiguous in-book "Enabled (tap to
  disable)" entry is now "Tracking: on (tap to pause)" — it pauses automatic
  session tracking and syncing for the current KOReader run (it was never a
  permanent setting, and now says so). Persistent options and diagnostics
  (auto-connect, update checks, Test connection, Re-resolve all books) moved
  into a **Settings** submenu, so the in-book menu no longer spills onto a
  second page. The gesture-opened popup menu now shows toggle states and opens
  submenus instead of silently ignoring them. (build 18 / 1.3.0)
- **Reading Stats is now a fully customisable dashboard.** The page looks the
  same on day one — the default boards replicate the old layout one-to-one —
  but everything is now a tile on a drag-and-resize grid: hit **Edit** to
  rearrange, resize, duplicate, or remove any tile (with undo), and configure
  tiles individually — chart style (bar/line/area), per-tile timeframe, a
  pick-your-own-metric stat card, and a Series Spotlight that focuses on a
  series of your choice. Boards are per-user and saved on the server, so your
  layout follows you across devices. Tabs are boards too: create new ones
  empty, duplicated from the current board, from a built-in default, or
  imported from a file — and share a board by exporting it as JSON. A camera
  button saves any board as a PNG. List tiles (Currently Reading, Recent
  Sessions, and friends) size themselves to their content in view mode, so two
  in-progress books no longer rattle around a five-row tile. The widget gallery
  has 35 entries, including
  new ones the old page never had: a paginated session log on Overview, reading
  by weekday, time-of-day split, time by format, recently finished, and a
  monthly streak calendar.

### Fixed
- The Activity strip in the book detail page's reading-stats panel rendered as
  empty space — the bars were laid out into a zero-height container after the
  panel's redesign. The per-day bars are back.
- The stats dashboard no longer slides in from the side when the page opens.
  The widget grid's first paint was laid out for a hardcoded 1280px width and
  then animated every tile over to the real container size; it now measures
  the container before mounting, so the board appears in place.
- On phones the new stats dashboard squeezed every tile into a narrow column
  with dead space beside it: the default "A lot" side-padding setting applied
  its 16% gutters even on a 390px screen, and the time-range pills overflowed
  the header, making the whole page scroll sideways. Phones now always get a
  slim fixed gutter (the padding setting still applies from tablet width up)
  and the range pills wrap onto their own header line instead of spilling off
  the edge.
- The 365-day reading heatmap bucketed days in UTC, so for anyone east of
  Greenwich an evening session could light up the wrong day (and dent a streak's
  look). It now uses local dates, matching how every other chart counts days.
- The KOReader sync status in Settings could fail to load for accounts that had
  used both the TomeSync plugin and a legacy KOSync client — the two record the
  last-sync time in different formats and the page errored trying to compare
  them. TomeSync is now treated as the primary source and the status loads
  reliably.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Send to KOReader (beta).** Queue a book from the web straight to your
  e-reader — no email, no Amazon Send-to-Kindle. It's the KOReader-native
  counterpart to email send-to-device: the original EPUB/CBZ arrives in your
  library folders (by series, or under the author for standalones) instead of
  being converted and dropped into a stock reader. The book detail page and the
  dashboard's bulk bar gain a split **Send to KOReader** button (the caret still
  offers "Send via email…"); the TomeSync plugin grows an **Inbox (N)** badge you
  tap to pull queued books (build 16 / 1.2.3). Delivery is a pull, not a push, so
  books arrive the next time KOReader checks in. Per-user — every connected
  KOReader shares one inbox. Off by default; enable with
  `TOME_SEND_TO_KOREADER=true`. See the
  [KOReader docs](https://tome.bndct.sh/docs/koreader#send-to-koreader).
- **Download a single book from KOReader.** The TomeSync plugin's series browser
  now drills into a per-volume list when you tap a series — pick one title to
  download on its own, or use the "Download all" row for the whole series as
  before. Standalone books with no series are now reachable too, through a
  "No Series" entry in the browser, so they no longer had to be fetched via OPDS
  or the web; each is filed under its author folder, matching Tome's library
  layout. Bumps the plugin to build 15 (1.2.2).

### Fixed
- **Relative timestamps no longer drift by your UTC offset.** The dashboard's
  Reading Log (and the notification bell and API-token "last used" times)
  showed sessions recorded minutes ago as "2h ago" for anyone not living on
  UTC: those endpoints emitted timestamps without an explicit timezone, so the
  browser parsed the UTC values as local time. All of them now carry the `Z`
  suffix the rest of the API already used.
- **The TomeSync plugin no longer breaks layout profiles that auto-execute on
  book open.** The "TomeSync: Server at X% (device: Y%)" message shown when
  another device had read ahead was a modal window, and KOReader delivers
  profile actions only to the topmost non-modal window — so a profile applying
  your layout (font size, margins, columns) on book open was silently swallowed
  exactly on those opens, leaving the book with default or stale layout
  settings. The message is now a passive toast that lets profile actions
  through. Also fixes two more issues in the same path: a position saved by the
  web reader no longer throws KOReader to page 1 (the plugin now recognises it
  isn't a KOReader-native position and jumps by percentage instead), and the
  book-open sync no longer runs twice per open. Bumps the plugin to build 17
  (1.2.4).
- **Series progress no longer shows as complete the moment you start the last
  book** (#36). The dashboard's "Series Progress" bar measured progress by the
  index of the book you were currently reading, so beginning book 2 of a 2-book
  series filled the bar to 100% before you'd finished it. It now reflects the
  number of volumes you've actually read, so the series only reads as complete
  once the last book is marked read.
- **The Bindery is now reachable from the mobile sidebar.** Admins
  could open the Bindery from the desktop sidebar but the link was missing from
  the mobile navigation drawer, so it was unreachable on a phone or the installed
  PWA. The admin-only Bindery entry (with its pending-count badge) now appears in
  the mobile drawer too.

## [1.3.2] — 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- **Reader font, size and theme no longer reset at every chapter** (#33). In the
  EPUB reader, changing the font, font size or background theme worked on the
  page you were on but was silently reverted the moment you turned into a new
  chapter — snapping back to whatever settings were saved when you first opened
  the book. The chapter-load handler was re-applying a stale snapshot of the
  reader settings captured at open time; it now always applies your current
  choices, so adjustments persist across chapters for the rest of the session.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- **Shared libraries are now actually shared** (#31). Marking a library *public*
  had no effect: the library list only ever returned libraries you owned (plus
  the built-in global ones), so a library created by one user was invisible to
  everyone else regardless of its public/private flag. Public libraries are now
  visible to all users, and their books show up for members too (previously only
  guests saw public-library books). Private libraries can be shared with
  individual people: the library editor gained a **Share with users** picker, and
  library owners — not just admins — can grant and revoke access to their own
  libraries. The rename/delete/add-to-library controls now appear only on
  libraries you can actually manage (your own, or any library if you're an admin),
  so you no longer see edit buttons that error out on libraries owned by someone
  else.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-06-05 — "Diary"

### Added
- **Single sign-on (OIDC).** Tome can now authenticate against an external
  OpenID Connect identity provider (Pocket ID, Authelia, Authentik, Keycloak,
  Zitadel, Google, …). When enabled, a configurable "Sign in with SSO" button
  appears on the login page; signing in provisions a Tome account and maps the
  provider's groups to Tome roles (admin / member / guest). Existing accounts can
  attach SSO via **Settings → Single Sign-On → Link SSO**, so you keep your
  library and reading history while gaining passkey login. Local username/password
  login always stays available, and at least one local admin remains a break-glass
  login regardless of identity-provider state. Off by
  default — set `TOME_OIDC_ENABLED=true` plus issuer/client credentials to turn
  it on. New env vars: `TOME_OIDC_ENABLED`, `TOME_OIDC_ISSUER`,
  `TOME_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `TOME_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`, `TOME_OIDC_REDIRECT_URL`,
  `TOME_OIDC_ADMIN_GROUP`, `TOME_OIDC_MEMBER_GROUP`, `TOME_OIDC_GUEST_GROUP`,
  `TOME_OIDC_DEFAULT_ROLE`, `TOME_OIDC_AUTO_CREATE`, `TOME_OIDC_ALLOWED_GROUP`,
  `TOME_OIDC_ROLE_SYNC`, `TOME_OIDC_BUTTON_LABEL` (see the SSO docs).
- **Per-series reading stats** on the series detail page. A collapsible "Reading
  Stats" card now appears between the series header and the volume grid for any
  series you have at least one session on: total time read across all volumes, a
  per-volume bar chart (unread volumes show as faint empty bars so gaps are
  visible), completion count and percentage, session count, pages turned, average
  time per volume, an estimated time remaining (based on finished-volume average),
  longest volume, and first/last read dates. Admins additionally see a
  library-wide aggregate line — total time, sessions, and distinct reader count
  across all users. Served by the new `GET /api/series/{name}/reading-stats`
  endpoint backed by the extended `backend/services/reading_stats.py`. The
  `StatTile` component is now shared from `frontend/src/components/stats/StatTile.tsx`.
- **Per-book reading stats** on the book detail page. A collapsible "Reading
  Stats" card now appears below the reading-status buttons for any book you
  have at least one session on: total time read, session count, pages turned,
  average session length, reading pace (pages/min), first and last read dates,
  an estimated time remaining (shown while the book is in "reading" status),
  and a compact daily activity bar chart. Admins additionally see a
  library-wide aggregate — total time, sessions, and distinct reader count
  across all users — in a small sub-section at the bottom of the card.
  Served by the new `GET /api/books/{book_id}/reading-stats` endpoint backed by
  the reusable `backend/services/reading_stats.py` aggregation helper.
- Highlight & note sync for KOReader, **bidirectional across devices**. Highlights
  and notes you make on one e-reader sync through Tome to your other KOReader
  devices (pulled when you open a book; pushed on suspend, on close, via **Sync
  now**, or the **TomeSync: Sync highlights** gesture), and show up in a
  **Highlights & Notes** section on the book's detail page — highlighted text,
  note, and chapter. The highlight's position is its identity (same passage on two
  devices = one highlight); edits resolve last-write-wins and deletes propagate via
  tombstones (a removed highlight won't reappear). Device-to-device needs the
  Tome-served copy of the book on both. Rendering highlights inside the web reader
  is a separate, later step. Plugin build 12. (TomeSync)
- `TOME_GOOGLE_BOOKS_KEY`: optionally supply your own Google Books API key.
  Without it, Google Books is queried anonymously against a shared global quota
  that is exhausted almost immediately, making the fallback silently return zero
  results — felt most acutely for non-English (e.g. traditional Chinese)
  catalogues that depend on Google for coverage. With a key set, requests are
  charged against your own Cloud project quota instead. Public-volume search
  only — no OAuth, no access to user data. A configured key that hits its quota
  now logs a clear warning instead of failing silently. (#10)

### Changed
- Book detail page layout: genres moved into the left sidebar (below the
  cover), book metadata consolidated into a collapsible "Details" grid below
  the description, and the description itself is now truncated with a "Show
  more" toggle. The reading-stats card and Highlights & Notes section sit in
  the same right column, giving the page a cleaner two-column structure.
- The home "Pick up where you left off" panel is now a compact cover strip
  instead of a full-width grid.

### Fixed
- Books sent with **Send to Device** now sync their reading position back from
  KOReader. They were emailed as a bare `Title.ext`, which the TomeSync resolver
  couldn't reliably match to a library book (it failed with "Book not resolved").
  Sent files are now named the same way KOReader names its OPDS downloads —
  `Author - Vol. X — Title.ext` — so they resolve through the path that already
  works for OPDS. No change for books already on a device; re-send to pick up the
  new name (#25).
- You can no longer lock yourself out by removing the last admin. Demoting,
  deactivating, or deleting a user is now refused with "Cannot remove the last
  admin" when they are the only remaining active admin — previously a single-user
  instance that changed its own role to member (or guest) had no way back through
  the UI and needed a manual database edit to recover.
- The PWA service worker no longer swallows full-page navigations to server
  routes. Its SPA navigation fallback was serving the cached app shell for *any*
  navigation, including `/api/*` and `/opds/*` — so on an installed/cached client
  the SSO handshake silently failed (the redirect to `/api/auth/oidc/login` and
  the provider's return to the callback both got the app shell, dropping you back
  to the dashboard instead of completing sign-in). The navigation fallback now
  excludes `/api` and `/opds`.
- Finishing a book on KOReader is now permanent. Previously, opening a finished
  book again (even briefly) could push a lower position percentage and silently
  un-finish it — dropping the status back to "reading" and erasing the 100%
  mark. Completion is now sticky: once a book reaches "read", any later position
  update from the device leaves the status and progress untouched. The device's
  resume position (used to reopen the book at the right place) still updates as
  normal, so returning to a finished book still opens at the last page. The same
  fix applies to reading sessions flushed from the plugin's offline queue.
  Finishing always normalizes progress to exactly 100%.
- Web reading progress now syncs to KOReader at the correct scale. Progress
  fractions are 0–1 throughout the stack, but the web reader was mistakenly
  dividing an already-fractional value by 100 before writing to the sync
  position table — so marking a book finished on the web synced as ~1% to
  KOReader, and mid-read positions appeared near the start of the book.
  Web and device positions now match.
- Login page could crash to a blank screen if you opened it while already signed
  in (e.g. returning to a tab with a live session) — a stale-session edge that
  tripped a React hooks error. The redirect now runs after the page's hooks.
- TomeSync (KOReader) sync silently failing on HTTPS deployments behind a
  reverse proxy (also released as the 1.2.1 hotfix). The plugin baked its server
  URL from the scheme the app server saw, which is `http` when TLS is terminated
  upstream — and if the proxy then redirected HTTP→HTTPS, KOReader could not
  follow the 307 on POST/PUT, so every reading session and position update failed
  (sessions piled up as "pending" and nothing reached the library). The server
  now honours `X-Forwarded-Proto` when baking the plugin's `SERVER_URL`, and a
  new optional `TOME_PUBLIC_URL` setting pins the canonical public origin
  explicitly. The plugin build was bumped so existing installs re-bake the
  corrected URL on **TomeSync → Check for updates**. Plain HTTP, LAN, and
  localhost deployments are unaffected.
- OPDS feeds are now served with the standard default Atom namespace
  (`<feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">`) instead of prefixed
  `ns0:` elements, so strict OPDS clients such as KOReader parse them and the
  catalog is no longer empty. The feed builder shared a process-global XML
  namespace map with the download metadata embedder; whichever module was
  imported last claimed the default prefix and silently broke the other.
  Namespace prefixes are now re-asserted, under a lock, at serialization time so
  they no longer depend on import order. The Content-Type was already
  `application/atom+xml`. (#15)
- Adding or editing a book type in admin settings no longer fails with a 422
  error. The create/edit form never sends a `slug` (it is derived from the
  label), but the API required one, so every save was rejected before it
  reached the handler. The slug is now optional and auto-derived from the label
  on create. (#12)
- Dismissing the home "Pick up where you left off" panel now persists across
  refreshes (it previously reappeared every reload). It resurfaces only if a
  different set of books surfaces.
- Series metadata embedded by Calibre (`calibre:series`) and EPUB3 collections
  (`belongs-to-collection`) is now read correctly on import. It was previously
  dropped — ingest fell back to parsing the title, which mis-grouped or failed
  to group same-series books whose titles lacked a "Vol. N".
- Genre/category tags embedded in EPUBs (`dc:subject` — what Calibre stores as
  "tags") are now imported as book tags. They were previously read only from CBZ
  `ComicInfo.xml`, so EPUB tags were silently dropped and shelf filters showed
  none. Tags also now round-trip back out on download — embedded as `dc:subject`
  in EPUBs and `<Genre>` in CBZ `ComicInfo.xml`. Applies to newly imported books;
  existing books are not retroactively re-tagged.

### Security
- Updated `react-router` to 7.17.0, clearing four advisories (an RCE in vendored
  turbo-stream plus three DoS / open-redirect issues). None were exploitable in
  Tome's static SPA, but the alerts are now resolved. (#27)

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-02 — "Press"

### Added
- TomeSync self-update: the KOReader plugin can now update itself from the
  server — **TomeSync → Check for updates** (manual) plus an opt-in
  **Auto-check on launch** toggle — replacing the SSH-into-every-device
  workflow. A bad update cannot brick: the plugin is split into a frozen
  stable shim (`main.lua`) and a replaceable implementation (`main_impl.lua`),
  and the shim runs an anti-brick rollback state machine — a syntax-broken
  update rolls back on the same boot, an init-crashing update rolls back on the
  next, and a corrupt download is rejected before it is ever swapped in.
  Reading progress, book mappings, and pending sessions live in KOReader
  settings, so updates never touch them.
- TomeSync gesture actions: **TomeSync: Open menu** (pops the full context-aware
  TomeSync menu) and **TomeSync: Browse series** (jumps straight to the series
  browser). Bindable from KOReader's Gesture manager, available in both the
  reader and the file manager.
- One-command installer (`install.sh`): a `curl | bash` path for newcomers and
  evals. Checks Docker is installed and running, writes `~/Tome` with a compose
  file and volumes, auto-picks a free port, pulls + starts, and waits until Tome
  answers. Re-running reuses the existing port and updates in place. ASCII-only,
  no `sudo`, never touches a real library. Docker Compose remains the primary,
  homelab-first install path; the one-liner is positioned as a "just want to try
  it?" option with a complete teardown note.

### Changed
- TomeSync plugin versioning: a hidden monotonic **build** integer (now `10`)
  drives update comparisons, with an independent human-facing **semver**
  (`1.0.1`). `GET /plugin/version` now returns `build` and `semver` alongside
  the existing `version` field (kept as `str(build)` for back-compat). New
  authenticated `GET /plugin/main-impl.lua` serves the config-baked
  implementation for self-update. The first shim+impl build must be installed
  manually once (the last SSH deploy); every update after is in-app.

### Fixed
- TomeSync series browser crashed (`attempt to concatenate field 'author'`)
  when a series' first book had no author. The server emitted JSON `null`,
  which rapidjson decodes to a truthy userdata sentinel, so the plugin's guard
  passed and then failed concatenating it. The server now omits the author when
  absent, and the plugin type-checks the field; the same hardening covers a
  null `series_index` in the series-download paths. Plugin build `10`.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-31 — "Vellum"

### Added
- Send to device: email books to a Kindle, Kobo, or any address straight
  from the web UI — single or bulk (max 25 per send). Per-user device list
  in Settings, admin Email tab (SMTP status, test email, all devices, send
  history). SMTP configured via `TOME_SMTP_*` env vars; 25 MB attachment
  limit; 50/user/day rate limit (`TOME_SMTP_DAILY_LIMIT`). Members and
  admins only.
- API token scopes: tokens can now be created with `"full"` (default) or
  `"readonly"` scope. Read-only tokens are blocked from non-GET requests.
  Existing tokens default to full access. Settings UI shows a scope dropdown
  on creation and a badge on read-only tokens.
- Opt-in parallel library scans via `TOME_SCAN_WORKERS` (default `1` = serial,
  in-process). Set it higher (e.g. CPU core count) to fan the CPU-bound
  extract/hash phase across worker processes for large imports; database writes
  stay single-process (SQLite single-writer). ~60–80 MB per worker.
- Wishlist: members and admins can wish for a book or a whole series. The add
  dialog has two modes — **Book** (structured search across Hardcover, Google
  Books, and OpenLibrary, plus a free-text fallback) and **Series** (Hardcover's
  series catalogue, so a series is disambiguated by author and carries its true
  volume count). Admins get a Wishlist tab; a matcher links wishes to library
  books both when a book is added (forward) and when a wish is created against
  books already present (reverse), author-aware so same-named series don't
  cross-match. Single-book wishes are fulfilled by linking a book; whole-series
  wishes are standing wants that stay open, show an "X of N" coverage strip
  (present volumes vs. the series total), notify the requester as each volume
  arrives, and close via "mark complete". In-app notifications via a new top-bar
  bell, plus email on fulfilment when SMTP is configured. The Series tab requires
  a Hardcover token (`hardcover_token`) — without it the dialog falls back to Book
  search only. Toggles: `TOME_WISHLIST_ENABLED`, `TOME_WISHLIST_MAX`.

### Changed
- Website: added raster favicons (`.ico` + `.png`) for Google search results
  and Cloudflare Web Analytics tracking snippet.
- Performance: faster library scans — removed per-book ORM lazy-loads, one
  directory walk instead of one-per-format, and throughput-oriented SQLite
  pragmas (`synchronous=NORMAL`, larger page cache, mmap). The book-list
  endpoint (`GET /api/books`) is also much faster — relationships are
  eager-loaded, eliminating an N+1 of ~3 queries per row.

### Fixed
- Full-text search now indexes books inline during scan / upload / ingest, so
  newly added books are searchable immediately — previously the index was only
  rebuilt at startup, leaving them invisible to search until the next restart.
- Cover-bearing files are no longer hashed twice during ingest.
- Bulk ZIP download now embeds Tome metadata like every other download path
  (single, OPDS, TomeSync) — previously it zipped the raw library files, so
  downloaded books carried stale/original metadata instead of Tome's. Library
  files on disk are still left untouched.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-25 — "Codex"

First stable release. Schema, API, and plugin protocol are now stable —
breaking changes get a major-version bump.

### Security
- Closed exploitable path-traversal in the upload/ingest endpoints (file
  basename is stripped before being joined to the temp directory, with a
  defense-in-depth resolved-path assertion).
- Global libraries (owner_id IS NULL) are now admin-only for mutations; any
  authenticated user including guests could previously delete every global
  library on a default install.
- `POST /api/libraries` now requires at least the `member` role.
- OPDS download and both comic-page streaming endpoints now apply
  `user_can_see_book` — closes IDORs where any user with auth could
  download books outside their visibility scope by guessing IDs.
- TomeSync `ApiKey` is now stored as `sha256(key)` rather than plaintext.
  Existing KOReader plugin installs keep working; database leak no longer
  yields a fleet of usable credentials.
- KOSync userkey now compared with `hmac.compare_digest` (timing-safe).
- `get_comic_page` now uses the same JWT signing key resolver as the rest
  of the app; was silently broken when `TOME_SECRET_KEY` was unset and the
  auto-generated `data/secret.key` was in use.
- `bindery.reject_book` now resolves cover deletions under `covers_dir`
  rather than the server's CWD.

### Added
- Per-user backup endpoint and Settings → Backup UI. Downloads a JSON
  snapshot of reading status, sessions, sync positions, shelves, and
  client preferences.
- Persistent KOReader sync-status badge in Dashboard and Stats headers
  (dot-only on mobile, full label on desktop).
- Unified reading-streak calculation: Dashboard and Stats now agree, with
  a 4-hour rollover so late-night reading sessions count toward the
  previous day.
- Download metadata embedding: EPUB downloads get OPF `dc:*` +
  `calibre:series`; CBZ downloads get `ComicInfo.xml` + prepended cover.
  Cached at `data/baked/`; auto-invalidates on metadata update.
- API tokens: user-level `tome_*` bearer tokens accepted on every `/api/*`
  endpoint. Created/revoked in Settings; admins can view all users' tokens.
- Admin duplicate detection: 4 strategies (content hash, ISBN,
  author+series+index, fuzzy title+author >85%). Merge or dismiss.
- Library health tool: lists misplaced files, one-click reorganise.
- Keyboard shortcuts modal (`?` to open).
- Scribe: Claude Code skill for batch ingest, metadata audits, series
  annotation. Alpha — command surface may change.
- Home tab with landing-page summary endpoints.
- Arcs and SeriesMeta with admin CRUD; volumes group by arc on series page.

### Fixed
- Infinite scroll re-attaches after switching dashboard tabs.
- SQLite connection-pool exhaustion under load (switched to NullPool).
- Comic reader view settings persist; final page now reports 100%.
- Session endpoint now updates reading status as safety net — catches up
  when position PUTs fail but queued sessions flush later.
- Progress scale normalised to 0–1 everywhere (was 0–100 from web reader).
- Web reader no longer overwrites KOSync progress with 0 on initial load.
- Fixed crash when opening KOReader-synced books (XPointer vs epubcfi).
- Naive datetime timestamps now include Z suffix for correct timezone display.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-17

### TomeSync Series Download (Plugin v4)
- Browse series from KOReader's wrench menu — lists all series in your
  library with book counts.
- Download full series or rest-of-series from within a book.
- Downloads organised by book type: `<download_dir>/<book_type>/<series_name>/`.
- Format preference: epub → kepub.epub → cbz → pdf → mobi → azw3.
- Skips books already on the device (matched by book ID).
- Plugin self-registers in KOReader's wrench menu.

### Roles & Permissions
- Replaced 14 granular permission flags with 3 roles: Admin, Member, Guest.
- Per-user book visibility: members see their own + assigned library books;
  guests see public only.

### Bindery Auto-Import
- Automatic ingestion from incoming directory on a configurable interval
  (`TOME_AUTO_IMPORT`, `TOME_AUTO_IMPORT_INTERVAL`).
- Unreviewed book queue with accept/reject workflow.

### Stats
- New Insights tab: completion estimates, year in review, period
  comparison, reading-speed trends.
- Per-book time breakdown, monthly comparison, genre over time.
- Fixed completion estimates to use actual progress gained.

### Themes
- Overhauled theme system: 3 built-in themes (light, dark, amber) plus
  fully custom themes via 10-value hex palette stored in localStorage.

### Web Reader
- Bidirectional position sync: web reader progress syncs to KOReader and back.
- Fixed crash when opening KOReader-synced books.

### UI
- Shift-click range selection across all list views.
- Mobile PWA improvements: safe areas, touch feedback, smoother animations.
- Fixed comic reader stuck spinner.
- Renamed Saved Filters to Shelves.

### Build
- `.dockerignore` for faster Docker builds.
