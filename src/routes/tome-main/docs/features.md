# Features

Detailed descriptions of Tome's features. For a quick overview, see the [README](../README.md).

---

## Quick Connect

Quick Connect lets you sign in on a new device without typing your password -- useful on mobile, shared computers, or anywhere with an awkward keyboard.

1. On the login page, tap **Quick Connect** to get a 6-character code.
2. On a device where you're already logged in, go to **Settings > Security** and enter the code.
3. The new device is signed in immediately.

Codes expire after a few minutes and can only be used once.

---

## API Tokens

User-level API tokens let scripts and external tools (including [Scribe](scribe.md)) authenticate against Tome without embedding a username and password.

To create one:

1. Go to **Settings → API Tokens** and click **Create Token**.
2. Give it a descriptive name (e.g. `scribe-laptop`, `nightly-backup`).
3. Copy the token — the full value is shown **once**. It cannot be retrieved later.

Tokens look like `tome_<32 random chars>` and can be revoked at any time. Every `/api/*` endpoint accepts either a JWT or a `tome_*` bearer token, and a token inherits the role and visibility of the user that created it — so tokens are as powerful as the user behind them.

Admins can view all users' tokens via the same page for auditing.

## Scribe

Scribe is a Claude Code Skill shipped with Tome (`skills/scribe/`) that turns [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) into a conversational ingest and metadata-curation tool. It talks to your Tome instance over HTTP using an API token, and supports three modes:

- **Ingest** — batch-upload a folder of new books, dedupe by content hash, fetch metadata, and apply high-confidence picks automatically.
- **Update** — refresh metadata on books already in Tome via free-text queries like `"update descriptions for the Classics library"`.
- **Audit** — scan for weak metadata (missing descriptions, years, covers) and series title drift, then propose bulk fixes.

Install with `./skills/scribe/install.sh`. Full setup and usage in [docs/scribe.md](scribe.md).

## OPDS PINs

OPDS PINs are short app-specific passwords for authenticating OPDS clients (KOReader, Panels, Chunky, etc.). Typing a full password on an e-ink keyboard is painful -- a 6-character PIN is much easier.

To set one up:

1. Go to **Settings > KOReader > OPDS PINs** and generate a new PIN.
2. In your OPDS client, enter your Tome username and the PIN as the password.
3. The OPDS feed URL is `http://<your-server>:8080/opds`.

Each PIN is independent -- you can have one per device and revoke any of them without affecting your main password or other devices. Your regular password continues to work alongside any PINs you've created.

---

## Themes

Tome ships with three built-in themes:

- Light
- Dark
- Amber

Switch themes in **Settings > Appearance**. The theme is stored per-browser, so different devices can use different themes.

### Interface Language

The web UI is translatable. Choose a language in **Settings > Appearance > Language**; on first visit Tome follows the browser language when a catalog exists for it. Translations are community-maintained `.po` files and anything untranslated falls back to English -- see [translating.md](translating.md) to improve or add one. The KOReader plugin, OPDS and the website stay English.

### Custom Themes

You can create a fully custom theme by pasting 10 comma-separated hex color values in **Settings > Appearance > Custom Theme**. The 10 values map to the theme's color palette in order. Custom themes are stored per-browser alongside your theme preference.

---

## Series Browsing

The sidebar shows all series in your library. Click a series to open an inline detail panel with:

- Volume grid with cover thumbnails
- Per-volume progress bars
- Continue reading button (jumps to the next unfinished volume)
- Mark all as read
- Publication status badge (ongoing, finished, hiatus, unknown) shown in the series list and detail header
- Story arcs — admins can split the volume grid into named sections (e.g. Berserk's Golden Age, Conviction, Fantasia) via the Manage button. Each arc has a name, volume range, and optional description; volumes outside any arc fall into an Unassigned section. Arcs can be filled in bulk from Claude's knowledge with `/scribe series <name>`.

---

## Ratings & Reviews

Rate the books you read on a 1–5 star scale, with an optional written review. Ratings are **per-user and private to you** — everyone keeps their own.

- **Per book** — the book detail page has a star rating and a review field. Both auto-save; the review collapses to a tidy quote (with an edit affordance) once written, rather than sitting as an always-open box.
- **On book cards** — your stars show across the library grid. You can **sort by "My Rating"** and **filter** the grid to `Rated`, `3+`, `4+`, or `5` stars.
- **Per series** — rate a whole series from its page. A series rating is **inherited** by every volume you haven't rated individually (your own volume rating always wins). A series' shown rating is your explicit rating if you set one, otherwise the average of your volume ratings — surfaced on series cards too. (The "No Series" group can't be rated.)

Stars use a theme-aware "rating gold" that fits each theme's palette. Ratings also sync both ways with KOReader's native Book status screen — see the [KOReader plugin](koreader-plugin.md) docs.

---

## Bulk Operations

Multi-select books on the dashboard to:

- Assign to a library
- Edit metadata (shared fields across selection)
- Fetch metadata from external sources
- Download as a ZIP archive
- Delete (removes the books and their files from disk — members can only delete their own uploads)

---

## Metadata Fetching

Search Google Books, OpenLibrary, and Hardcover for metadata. Results are shown in a side-by-side diff UI so you can see exactly what will change before applying. Hardcover results are prioritized when a `TOME_HARDCOVER_TOKEN` is configured.

By default Google Books is queried anonymously against a shared quota, which can hit `429`/`400` "Quota Exceeded" errors — most noticeable for non-English (e.g. traditional Chinese) catalogues that lean on Google as the fallback. Set `TOME_GOOGLE_BOOKS_KEY` to a free [Google Books API key](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using) and requests are charged against your own Cloud project quota instead. It's a plain public-search API key — no OAuth and no access to any user's private data.

---

## Cover Picker

Click any book's cover to open the cover picker. Search Google Books and OpenLibrary for alternative covers, or upload one from your device.

---

## Authentication and Roles

- JWT-based auth with first-run setup wizard
- Role-based user management (Admin / Member / Guest)
- Force password change on first login
- Admin impersonation (act as another user for debugging)

### Roles

| Role | What they can do |
|---|---|
| **Admin** | Everything — full access to all books, settings, users, bindery, and admin tools |
| **Member** | Upload books, download, edit/delete their own books, manage libraries, use OPDS/KOSync, view stats, bulk operations |
| **Guest** | Browse, download, and read books; access the OPDS feed |

### Per-User Book Visibility

- **Admins** see all books in the library
- **Members** see books added by admins, their own uploads, and books in libraries they have been assigned to. The dashboard shows a "My Books / Shared Library" filter to switch between the two views
- **Guests** see books added by admins and books in public libraries

Admins have an additional uploader dropdown filter on the dashboard to view books by a specific user.

### Content Restrictions

Admins can narrow an individual account further under **Admin > Users**:

- **Hidden tags** -- a comma-separated list. Books carrying any of these tags (matched case-insensitively) are invisible to that user everywhere: browsing, search, filters, OPDS and the KOReader plugin, including the user's own uploads. Untagged books are not affected, so tag first, then hide.
- **Downloads per day** -- a cap on files fetched per UTC day, enforced on every download path (single file, bulk ZIP, OPDS, TomeSync). Blank means unlimited, `0` disables downloads.

Admin accounts are never restricted.

---

## Filtering

The dashboard filter bar narrows the grid by **Series**, **Author**, **Tag**, **Format**, and **Language**, plus reading status, rating, and (for admins) uploader. Filters combine, show as removable chips, and live in the URL — so a filtered view is shareable and can be saved as a Shelf.

### Language

The **Language** dropdown appears whenever your catalogue holds more than one language. There is no language *detection* — Tome never inspects the book's text. It reads the language each file *declares* in its embedded metadata (an EPUB's `<dc:language>`, a CBZ's `LanguageISO`, etc.), captured at scan/upload time. A book whose file declares nothing has no language and simply doesn't appear in the dropdown.

Because that declared value is inconsistent across files — `en`, `eng`, `en-US`, and `English` all mean the same thing — Tome folds it to a single canonical entry before showing it. Matching is a static lookup (`backend/services/languages.py`), tried in order:

1. **Whole-string match** against a table of ISO-639-2 three-letter codes and English names (`eng` / `english` → `en`, `ger` / `deu` / `german` → `de`, …).
2. **Base token** of a region/script-tagged value against the known two-letter codes (`en-US` → `en`, `zh-Hant` → `zh`).
3. **Base token** against the alias table, as a fallback (`eng-US` → `en`).

If nothing matches, the lowercased base token is kept as-is, so an unrecognized language still groups consistently — it just shows as an upper-cased code (e.g. `TL`) rather than a friendly name until it's added to the table. Note this is deliberate, not lossy by accident: `pt-BR` and `pt-PT` both collapse to "Portuguese", which is what you want in a filter dropdown.

## Shelves

Shelves (formerly called Saved Filters) let you save any combination of active dashboard filters — search text, book type, library, series, author, tags, format, language, sort order — as a named entry in the sidebar. Click a shelf to instantly restore that view. This is also the simplest way to get a "library per language": filter by a language and save it as a Shelf — it self-populates as matching books arrive, with nothing to add by hand.

Shelves are per-user and private. Each shelf can have a custom icon chosen from the icon picker.

---

## Reading Stats

The Stats page has three tabs, all powered by KOReader session data via TomeSync. The time-based charts can also be **backfilled from KOReader's own per-page reading history** (from before TomeSync) by enabling reading-history import in the plugin — see the [KOReader plugin](koreader-plugin.md#reading-history-import) docs. The backfill adds reading time and pages only; it never changes your read/unread status.

### Overview

Top-line numbers — total reading time, sessions, pages turned, streak — plus the recent session log and a "currently reading" panel.

### Habits

When and how you read:

- **When You Read** — hour × day-of-week heatmap
- **Session timeline** — per-day session ribbons across the last two weeks
- **Reading pace** — pages per hour over time, plus pace by format
- **Reading speed trend** — how your pages-per-hour has changed over time
- **Completion estimates** — projected finish dates for in-progress books based on recent pace
- **Period & monthly comparison** — compare two time windows side by side

### Library

How your collection grows and what you finish:

- **Year in review** — books read, pages, and time spent in a given year
- **Series completion** — how far you are through each series
- **Author affinity** — most-read authors
- **Completion by type** — finish rates per book type
- **Per-book time table** — total time, sessions, and pages turned for every book
- **Library growth** — books added over time
- **Backlog** -- how long your unstarted books would take at your own pace (hours from word count x your reading speed, days from your recent minutes per day), scoped to Want to Read, all unread, a library, or a shelf. The same estimate shows as "Est. read time" on the book page and "left in this series" on the series page
