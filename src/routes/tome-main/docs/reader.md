# Built-in Reader

Tome has a built-in reader that handles EPUBs, manga/comics (CBZ/CBR), and PDFs directly in the browser. Click the "Read" button on any book detail page to open it.

## EPUB Reader

- Table of contents sidebar
- Three themes: light, sepia, dark
- Adjustable font size and font family (serif, sans-serif, monospace)
- Reading position saved automatically via EPUB CFI -- reopen a book and you're right where you left off
- Progress percentage tracked and visible on the dashboard
- Tap zones -- on touch screens, choose in the reader settings whether tapping the right side (Default) or the left side (Swapped) turns to the next page, or turn taps off and swipe only. Shared with the comic reader, stored per browser

## Comic/Manga Reader (CBZ/CBR)

Pages are streamed individually from the server -- no need to download the entire archive before reading.

- **Page navigation** -- click/tap left or right half of the screen, use arrow keys, or swipe on mobile
- **Tap zones** -- Default (tap right for next), Swapped (tap left for next, for one-handed reading), or Off (swipe only). Set in the reader settings panel; RTL volumes keep advancing in their reading direction
- **Two-page spread** -- auto-enabled on wide screens, toggle with `S` key. Pages display side-by-side like an open book
- **RTL (right-to-left)** -- auto-enabled for manga book types. Page order and navigation direction flip so manga reads correctly. Toggle with `R` key
- **Fit modes** -- fit-to-width or fit-to-height, toggle with `W` key
- **Pinch-to-zoom** -- on mobile, pinch to zoom into panels. Double-tap to reset. Pan while zoomed
- **Webtoon/scroll mode** -- for manhwa and vertical-scroll comics. Toggle via the toolbar button. Renders all pages in a continuous vertical scroll instead of page-by-page
- **Page thumbnails** -- toggle a thumbnail strip at the bottom to jump to any page at a glance
- **Fullscreen** -- press `F` to toggle
- **Theme support** -- reader background respects your chosen theme (no white flash between pages in dark mode)
- **Progress tracking** -- current page saved automatically. Reopen and you're on the same page
- **Preloading** -- adjacent pages are preloaded in the background for instant page turns

## ComicInfo.xml Support

CBZ and CBR files containing a `ComicInfo.xml` (the ComicRack/Kavita/Komga standard) get automatic metadata extraction:

- Title, series, volume/issue number, author, publisher, year, language, description
- Genre tags imported automatically
- Manga flag detected -- books with `<Manga>Yes</Manga>` are auto-assigned the Manga book type and default to RTL reading
