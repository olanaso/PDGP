"""Tripwires for the plugin's bidirectional book-rating sync.

KOReader stores a native 1–5 star rating + free-text review in each book's
sidecar (`summary.rating` / `summary.note`). Tome holds the same per-user
rating/review on UserBookStatus. The plugin reconciles them, using a saved
baseline to tell which side changed since the last sync:

    only device changed  -> push device → Tome
    only Tome changed     -> write Tome → device sidecar
    both changed (tie)    -> Tome wins (single source of truth)

These can't execute KOReader; they pin the load-bearing properties on the
generated Lua so a refactor can't silently revert them.
