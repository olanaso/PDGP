"""Regression tests for the plugin's book-open sync (`_initSession`).

Background (reported on Reddit against v1.3.2): the "TomeSync: Server at X%
(device: Y%)" message was an ``InfoMessage`` — a modal window. KOReader's
Profiles plugin auto-executes "on book opening" profiles right after
ReaderReady via ``UIManager:sendEvent``, which delivers events only to the
topmost *non-toast* window. The modal swallowed every profile action (font
size, margins, columns) exactly on opens where another device had read ahead,
so users' layout profiles silently failed to apply. Two more bugs lived in the
same function: a web-reader position (foliate ``epubcfi(...)``) fed to
``onGotoXPointer`` lands on page 1, and ``_initSession`` could run twice per
open.

These are tripwires on the generated Lua: they can't execute KOReader, but
they pin the load-bearing properties of the fix so a refactor can't silently
revert them.
