"""Regression tests for the URL baked into the KOReader plugin's SERVER_URL.

Background: on HTTPS deployments behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy, the app
server sees ``http``; if the proxy then redirects HTTP→HTTPS, KOReader can't
follow the 307 on POST/PUT and every sync fails. The bake must honour
``X-Forwarded-Proto`` (and an explicit ``TOME_PUBLIC_URL``) so it produces
``https`` for those deployments — while leaving plain HTTP / LAN / localhost
deployments baking exactly what they did before.

# ── Release guard: the build MUST be bumped or devices won't re-bake ──────────

def test_build_bumped_for_rebake():
    # Must exceed every build already live (v1.2.0 shipped 10; main reached 12),
    # so all existing installs re-download and re-bake the corrected URL.
    # 1.5.0 / build 20 added bidirectional book-rating sync (KOReader's native
    # star rating + review <-> Tome) on top of 19's download path templates.
    # 1.5.1 / build 21 queues ratings set offline so a finished book you never
    # reopen still syncs its rating (the per-book open/close push alone missed it).
    # 1.6.0 / build 22 imports KOReader's statistics.sqlite3 (per-page reading
    # history) so stats backfill reading from before TomeSync (time & pages only).
    # 1.6.1 / build 23 makes the sync back-off time-based (+ clears on
    # NetworkConnected) so it self-heals instead of latching offline after sleep.
    # 1.6.2 / build 24 files each download under its own book type (issue #88):
    # the No Series bucket mixes types, so a single batch type misfiled standalone
    # books (e.g. RoyalRoad titles landing in light_novel).
    # 1.7.0 / build 25 adopts web-created highlights: annotations made in Tome's
    # web reader arrive under a provisional "web:" anchor; the plugin locates the
    # text natively, creates a first-class KOReader highlight, and the sync push
    # (adopted_from) retires the provisional server-side.
    # 1.7.1 / build 26 makes the reading-history backfill memory-bounded:
    # keyset-windowed reads over (start_time, rowid) instead of loading every
    # page-stat row since the watermark at once, and each upload chunk carries
    # only the books it references. Verified against a 34k-row device DB.
    # 1.7.2 / build 27 adds deterministic book identity: the plugin sends the
    # file's KOReader partial-MD5 with resolve calls; the server matches it
    # against ko_hashes (recorded at scan/serve time) before any filename
    # heuristics — renamed/moved device files resolve exactly.
    # 1.7.3 / build 28 verifies foreign highlights before painting them: the
    # anchor must reproduce its highlighted text on this copy; mismatches are
    # repaired by text search (rendered locally, server identity kept via
    # repair_map — no cross-device anchor ping-pong); unlocatable text is
    # skipped rather than painted on the wrong words.
    # 1.7.4 / build 29 is the UX batch: bounded socketutil timeouts on every
    # request (no more global http.TIMEOUT mutation; a dead server stalls the
    # UI seconds, not a minute), failed fetches/downloads offer Retry,
    # downloads show live byte/percent progress, a single fresh download
    # offers "Open now?", volume rows are marked "· on device", and the
    # position heartbeat is idle-debounced off the page-turn path. (A Trapper
    # subprocess variant for fetches was built and dropped: forked sockets
    # from plugin context proved unverifiable on the emulator.)
    # Build numbering note: TWO build 26s shipped from parallel branches on
    # 2026-07-03 (main: the paging-annotation guard; the foundations stack:
    # the memory-bounded backfill). The merge resolves to build 30 so every
    # device re-fetches regardless of which 26 it took; 27-29 are the
    # foundations-stack builds (identity+clustering, verify/repair, UX batch),
    # and the paging guard's semantics are folded into _applyForeign.
    # 1.8.0 / build 31 introduces half-star ratings server-side: the plugin's
    # rating_baseline splits into {remote, device} so a Tome half-star rounded
    # onto the whole-star sidecar is never pushed back as a "local edit".
    # 1.9.0 / build 35 adds sync on suspend (issue #128): opt-in catch-up of
    # pending sessions/ratings + reading-history backfill at lid close, with an
    # aggressive variant that turns WiFi on first; onNetworkConnected also runs
    # the history backfill (was launch-only) and flushes without an open book.
    # 1.10.0 / build 36 adds the Shelves browse axis: the device lists the
    # user's shelves and drills into their resolved book lists
    # (GET /tome-sync/{shelves,shelf-books}); mixed lists download per-book.
    # 1.11.0 / build 37 adds idle-capped session accounting (issue #150):
    # active time accumulates per page turn with each gap credited at most
    # the idle cap (default 10 min, configurable, 0 = off), so a device left
    # awake unread no longer books wall-clock time; ended_at becomes the last
    # activity plus the final credit rather than the eventual suspend.
    # 1.11.1 / build 38 fixes popup menus (series browser, authors, shelves,
    # inbox, gesture menu) passing show_parent = self.ui: when a full-screen
    # home-screen plugin (e.g. bookshelf.koplugin) sits above the FileManager,
    # repaints routed at the hidden FileManager are skipped entirely, so page
    # flips inside the popup never redraw. Menus now use the Menu default
    # (show_parent = the menu itself), which is always the visible window.
    # 1.12.0 / build 39 makes "Sync now" pull before it pushes (issue #175):
    # the server position runs through the same forward/backward pull-conflict
    # strategy as book open, so a device that is behind no longer overwrites
    # newer progress from another device. Pairs with the server-side
    # TOME_KOSYNC_POSITION_BRIDGE read bridge (experimental, default off).
    # 1.13.0 / build 40 gives every device a real identity (issue #181): the
    # reported name is Device.model or a user-set "Device name" instead of the
    # literal "KOReader" every install used to send, so devices stop sharing
    # one reading-history watermark; imported history + watermark migrate to
    # the new name on first sync via /tome-sync/stats/rename-device.
    # 1.14.0 / build 41 makes the connection device-editable (#181, #185): the
    # baked server URL / API key / username become overridable defaults; the
    # URL is edited in Settings (a stranded device can't self-update its way
    # out of a moved server), credentials arrive via "Sign in with code"
    # (Quick Connect pairing mints a fresh plugin API key; username derived
    # from /auth/me, never typed).
    # 1.15.0 / build 42 adds metadata sync (issue #210): Tome's title, author,
    # series, tags, description and cover are written into KOReader's own
    # custom-metadata sidecar for books on the device (opt-in, hash-verified
    # per file, the book files themselves never modified).
    # 1.15.1 / build 43 runs metadata sync as one-file-per-tick scheduled
    # steps with a progress notification: the first run on a Kindle froze
    # the home screen ~30 s (35 covers + document opens in three bursts).
    # 1.15.2 / build 44 updates the cover-browser cache row in place instead
    # of deleting it (bookshelf series views lost the books whose rows were
    # gone) and queues a background re-extraction for rows already missing.
    # 1.15.3 / build 45 broadcasts BookMetadataChanged after the self-heal
    # rebuilt cache rows (bookshelf's series list stayed stale otherwise).
