"""The plugin's reading-history backfill must stay memory-bounded.

The original implementation materialised every ``page_stat_data`` row since the
watermark into one Lua table (tens of thousands of rows on a real device) and
resent the full ``books`` array with every chunk. These tests pin the windowed
replacement: keyset pagination over (start_time, rowid), short-lived read-only
connections per window, and per-chunk book subsetting. The server import is
idempotent (INSERT OR IGNORE on the identity key), which is what makes the
watermark-boundary refetch safe — that contract is asserted here too.
